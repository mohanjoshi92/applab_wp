They&#8217;re pretty nice, useful shortcuts when you know them, but there&#8217;s a good chance you may not know what they are or why you might want to use them.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>What&#8217;s a block pattern?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Patterns are&nbsp;<strong>collections of pre-arranged blocks</strong>&nbsp;that can be combined and arranged in many ways making it easier to create beautiful content. They act as a head-start, leaving you to plug and play with your content as you see fit and be as simple as single blocks or as complex as a full-page layout.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"632\" height=\"414\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2021/03/block-library.png?resize=632%2C414&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-10021\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2021/03/block-library.png?resize=1024%2C670&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2021/03/block-library.png?resize=300%2C196&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2021/03/block-library.png?resize=768%2C503&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2021/03/block-library.png?resize=1536%2C1005&amp;ssl=1 1536w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2021/03/block-library.png?resize=2048%2C1340&amp;ssl=1 2048w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2021/03/block-library.png?w=1264&amp;ssl=1 1264w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2021/03/block-library.png?w=1896&amp;ssl=1 1896w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 632px) 100vw, 632px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>They live in a tab in the block library.

The <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/themes/tt1-blocks/\">TT1 Blocks theme</a> (which is a fancy name for &#8220;TwentyTwentyOne Blocks&#8221;) stores images in the theme library.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Now what?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The thing about a block pattern is, as soon as you insert it from the block library, it stops being <em>a cohesive unit</em> — now it&#8217;s just a smattering of blocks, detached from the pattern you created and meant to be customized to your liking. It&#8217;s a <em>shortcut</em>, not a <em>template</em>. That also means you don&#8217;t have to worry about switching themes or deactivating pattern plugins: the blocks you already inserted won&#8217;t go anywhere.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That being said, if you like this one pattern so much you want to use it again and again, with no customization at all, you can make it into a <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/news/2021/02/gutenberg-tutorial-reusable-blocks/\">reusable block</a>:</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-video\"><video controls loop src=\"https://wordpress.org/news/files/2021/03/reusable-block.mp4\"></video></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Reusable blocks are created, as the name implies, to be reused. The feature is a great way to store small bits of commonly used snippets that you can edit in one place to update in all. &#8220;<strong>Follow me on Twitter</strong>,&#8221; &#8220;<strong>Article series</strong>,<strong>&#8220;</strong> or <strong>&#8220;Subscribe to my podcast&#8221;</strong> are great examples of that.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>What makes a good block pattern?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Patterns, as they ship today, are limited by the features available. If the block editor doesn&#8217;t allow you to customize letter-spacing, your block pattern can&#8217;t either.

I&#8217;m your host, Josepha Haden Chomphosy. Here we go!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Josepha [0:41]: This month, we have a bonus briefing, so I&#8217;ve asked my dear friend and colleague <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/matveb/\">Matías Ventura</a> to join me. Matías was recently called “the spark behind the vision of Gutenberg.” With full site editing coming our way in 202, I asked if he would join me for a quick Q&amp;A. Welcome, Matías.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Matías [0:56]: Hello, hello! Thanks for inviting me. It&#8217;s a pleasure to be here.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Josepha [1:00]: Well, I&#8217;m delighted to have you. And I think that we have a lot of excellent questions. All right, so Matías, we actually ended up with questions in about three different groupings. And so I&#8217;m going to start with the “what is it about full site editing,” sorts of questions that people had. We&#8217;re gonna work our way into “what are we doing with it?” and then “how are we planning on getting this out the door?” Then, a couple of big picture questions that people asked. We&#8217;re just gonna leap right in this full site editing part of the Gutenberg plugin, or is it a standalone plugin?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Matías [1:39]: Okay, we&#8217;ll start with the basics. Full site editing is part of the Gutenberg plugin right now. I think it&#8217;s important to mention that full site editing is like an umbrella for several projects that we&#8217;re working on. They are all aiming to bring blocks into more parts of your site so that editing becomes easier and more expressive, and so on. So full site editing right now encompasses adding a ton of new blocks. I think we have around 20 new blocks coming in, including navigation query, site, title, logo, etc. There&#8217;s also the interface to interact with templates outside of the content; that&#8217;s another big part of the full site editing project. We also have a lot of new design tools included, many of these have been released in previous major releases, but they still comprise a strong part of what full site editing is. We also have something called Global Styles, which aims to allow people to configure the visual aspects of blogs across the entire site, not just on any individual blog. And of course, then there&#8217;s a whole layer of how we utilize these tools. It can get complex because there are many layers and projects that need to come together. So yeah, all of these are accessible through the Gutenberg plugin right now.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Josepha [3:07]: Yeah. So it&#8217;s not a standalone plugin. If you wanted to check out full site editing the site editor experience as it is now, you would just have to make sure you had the Gutenberg plugin on your site. Right?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Matías: Yes, correct.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Josepha:&nbsp; So a couple of the questions related to this are how exactly do I enable it on my site? And what is the easiest and safest way to try this on my site? And I think the answer is, is right in there. It&#8217;s in the Gutenberg plugin. And so if you have that plugin, you don&#8217;t need the testing plugin or anything else to make that work, right?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Matías [3:51]:&nbsp; No, you like, you might need to install a theme like Twenty Twenty One blocks that unlock some of these new interfaces that we just talked about. Like other of these pieces are available for anything. But some of these, like the interface to edit templates, right now only talk with things that know how to express their desire.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Josepha [4:14]: And I think we have less than 10 themes right now that do that, but I&#8217;ll leave some links to at least 2021 blocks in the show notes. And then, if there are another one or two themes that I can find, I can add those in there as well.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So you have to have the Gutenberg plugin; you have to have a theme that works with that site editor kind of experience. And then you&#8217;re safe to try everything out. It shows up in your left toolbar just like any other thing, like if you were working with plugins, or if you were adding a post or anything else, right?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Matías [4:51]: Yes, correct. And so, some of these details are being worked on right now. Like how and where you access things, and so on. These things are subject to change, but right now, you have this site editor beta in the sidebar when both you have the plugin running and a theme that&#8217;s capable.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Josepha [5:10]: Yeah. Excellent note. If you are running this on a production website, I would recommend you not do that unless you are very, very good with WordPress. It&#8217;s a really safe and easy thing to test and try out. But because it is still in beta, I recommend always putting it on a test site. I have a couple of different test sites that I run on myself. Another question that I had was, “will full site editing slow down my site?” And I think we have some refreshed performance tests coming out about that. And maybe they&#8217;ll be out by the time we publish this podcast.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Matías [5:49]: Yeah, I mean, like the performance has been one of the major focuses for the whole project. In many cases, it should speed up things because we&#8217;re like, I think one of the big pieces that these projects bring into the picture, especially for themes, is that it allows only the necessary assets to be loaded on the front end. For example, if for a given page, there are, I don&#8217;t know, 10-15 blocks being used, you would only get the CSS and scrapes and so on related to those blocks. This can cut down on a lot a ton of CSS that themes used to end queue on a side, particularly if you were trying to customize many widgets and so on, like a lot of themes have the full styles or multiple widgets, even third party plugins, and so on. So one of the advantages of having this blog system is that we can know at the time of rendering what blogs are being used and only load those assets.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Josepha [6:50]: Excellent. Another big question that we have is, “does full site editing work with the classic editor? And does it work with other builders?” I think that&#8217;s a really big answer if you&#8217;re going to get super deep into it. But I think that the short answer is yes, it does. Is that fair?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Matías [7:08]: Yeah, I don&#8217;t think it touches a bit on that full site editing is not like a single thing. There are multiple projects around it. So again, like the template editor that only deals with blogs, it doesn&#8217;t have a lot to do with a classic editor. But the classic editor use for both doesn&#8217;t change anything at all; like the same way that when the block editor was introduced, it didn&#8217;t change how you could still write posts in the classic editor. You will still be able to do that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Josepha [7:41]: And if you are brand new to WordPress person, or, I mean, I guess at this point, you don&#8217;t have to be super brand new. If you&#8217;re fairly new to WordPress person and have no idea what we&#8217;re talking about when we say the classic editor, you don&#8217;t really have to worry about it either. You don&#8217;t have to go and find out what that is; the block editor that you have right now works perfectly for what you&#8217;re trying to do. So if you don&#8217;t know what I mean when I say classic editor, don&#8217;t worry about chasing it down either.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think that this last question we accidentally answered earlier, but I&#8217;m going to go ahead and ask it anyway since I received it. “I keep hearing that you can use the site editor with the 2021 theme. But I don&#8217;t seem to be able to. What am I missing?” I think the answer is that there&#8217;s the Twenty Twenty One theme shipped with the WordPress release 5.6. And then there is the Twenty Twenty One blocks theme; those are two different themes. The link to the Twenty Twenty One block theme is going to be in our show notes this time around. And so, if you have been trying to use the full site editor with Twenty Twenty One and not succeeding, try the link to the one below. And I bet that that will work for you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Matías [8:50]: Yes, that&#8217;s correct.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Josepha [8:51]: All right, excellent. Well, that brings us kind of into our second set of questions, which is about how we are doing it. The first one that folks have is “will full site editing be on by default in the next release. In this context, the next release is WordPress 5.8. But I think it&#8217;s a safe question to ask if full site editing will be on by default in the release that it&#8217;s planned for.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Matías [9:15]: Yeah, and for this, I need to go back to the same principle of many projects because there are many pieces of full site editing, and we have been merging them in major releases, particularly like the blocks and the design tools. There are more coming in that we want to make accessible as soon as possible. The full experience that requires a theme to opt-in to templates using blogs won’t be by default; it requires a specific theme running. A lot of these details we&#8217;re still like determining exactly what projects are ready to be merged and so on. But yeah, if you have a theme right now that works the way you want, it doesn&#8217;t change anything there. If anything, it adds some more capabilities and more customization tools, and so on. And the theme can also regulate how much they want to incorporate.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Josepha [10:13]: Matías, you&#8217;ve mentioned a couple of times in this podcast so far like this is a really complex and really complicated part of this work. And just for anyone out there who&#8217;s either encountering Gutenberg or full site editing or this podcast for the first time, I think a tiny bit of context that&#8217;s worth having here is that Matías and I have been working on this together in various capacities for like, five years. And Matías has probably been working on this for practically a decade. So, when we say that this is a really complicated problem, and when we say that this is a complex set of issues that we&#8217;re working with like, it is all that we have been thinking about for I want to say at least the last three or four years, but certainly it&#8217;s all that we have been trying to untangle for quite a bit of time before that as well. So we don&#8217;t take it lightly when we&#8217;re like, “this is complicated;” we mean it. It&#8217;s really complicated. And we&#8217;re trying our hardest over here as WordPress.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The next big question, since we&#8217;re all stuck in the “it&#8217;s very complicated,” part of things is the question, “will this update break my current site?” Like, if I have a site that is updated and ready, and it&#8217;s exactly as I wanted it to be, and it took me two years to get there will full site editing, whichever release it&#8217;s in. Currently, 5.8 is what we&#8217;re planning for. Will that break anything on my site as I know it right now?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Matías [11:44]: No, not at all. One of the major things that the WordPress team, the WordPress community, always cares so much about, never to break things. Many of these things are stepping stones that you can adopt, as we&#8217;ve talked about full site editing. But for example, we also have a few concurrent projects around the widget screen and the navigation screen that are meant to bring blocks into existing interfaces. So again, the theme doesn&#8217;t need to change, and a lot of care is being put into making this more like you&#8217;re unlocking new features, and nothing really breaks or falls apart.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Josepha [12:23]: This update, like all the other updates, should have minimal, minimal impact on what you have to actively fix on your site. Every once in a while, a bug is gonna get by. We can&#8217;t say that we&#8217;re 100% perfect with not breaking things. But also, we always and I and I know that we&#8217;re planning on this for our remaining releases for the rest of the year. At the very least, I can&#8217;t imagine we&#8217;d ever change it. But after every major release, we always make a plan to have a minor release within the next one or two weeks. Because we know that a broken thing on a site is really incredibly impactful, even if you&#8217;re only 1% of the sites that had that happen to it. And so I think that&#8217;s true in this case, too. And getting that feedback back from all of the people who are actually using WordPress is the thing that makes us be able to kind of move quickly when we do see those problems.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the questions that we have been getting is, “can I see a live preview without saving the changes that I made?” When I got this question, I didn&#8217;t actually understand it. And so I went and looked at a site without the Gutenberg plugin on it, and then a site with the Gutenberg plugin on it. And of course, on sites without Gutenberg, without the block editor, without full site editing, when you are looking to preview, you have the option to open up your preview in a new window. And you don&#8217;t have that with Gutenberg because it&#8217;s supposed to be a true WYSIWYG editor. A true what you see is what you get, editor. I think that the answer to this is, yes, you can see a live preview without actually saving the changes on the front end of your site. But you don&#8217;t actually have to reload anything. You don&#8217;t have to open it up in a new window. You don&#8217;t have to, like, actively click “please show me a preview” because what you see in your editing screen should be what you see at the end of your app as an end-user.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Matías [14:28]: Yeah, that&#8217;s the sort of the main gist to it. Yes, the site editor is built so that it always reflects the front end as truly as possible, so that&#8217;s one layer. Also, the preview tools should allow you to see in different devices like mobile breakpoints, and I don&#8217;t know if they will have breakpoints and stuff like that. There are a lot of things in the current interface that is just not enabled. There are some challenges in the sidebar. Because the site editor is not just focused on a single post, it&#8217;s focused on the entire site. So, there can be many, many changes that need to be shadowed for the site.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;re changing the site title, some of the global styles, aspects, and so on need to be orchestrated. So, to see in the previewing new window, there are some challenges there to integrate. Again, the interface is not final yet; a lot of these things are still being tweaked and improved. There are many things from the regular post editor that are not enabled yet. But they will be enabled. So yeah, it&#8217;s a, I guess, it&#8217;s not a simple thing to answer. Because, again, the idea of previewing the site that&#8217;s core to the whole project is that you&#8217;re always interacting in the same way that when you&#8217;re in the customizer, you&#8217;re seeing the preview all the time. That&#8217;s the main scope of this project,</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Josepha [15:54]: Excellent. Changes like that changes to your workflow can be really hard to get your mind around, especially if part of that existing workflow was there to create some confidence in what you&#8217;re seeing with your users. And so I understand. Now that I&#8217;ve researched that question a bit, I see where that&#8217;s coming from. Based on existing workflows and existing patterns that we have for ourselves in WordPress, will we need to have a theme to use the full site editor?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Matías [16:33]: I think we&#8217;ve already covered some of these. And again, they are tools that can work on any existing theme. There is other stuff that needs space-specific themes to opt-in into these tools, like blog templates and so on.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Josepha [16:50]: Yes, I think the question that we have next, because I see that the literal next question I have is actually something we have covered; just because we&#8217;re being pretty conversational about it, not because anyone already asked the question. So I&#8217;m actually going to skip to the last question of this section that I received. I got this next one via Twitter. The question is, “how do you view the role of themes once full site editing is fully rolled out and all the page elements (content, headers, widgets, footers, etc.) and all the views are managed via blocks and block patterns? Will things become typographic and block styles?”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Matías [17:28]: I think this is a great question because it goes to the heart of, why are we doing all this. One of the main reasons is to empower users more. WordPress has been democratizing publishing for a while; this is another step into allowing themes to get more customization tools and more control over their site if they want to. I think the recent call for testing has focused on the 404 page, for example. That&#8217;s something that forever has been locked away from users. And it&#8217;s also something that, as a theme developer, and I used to develop themes a long time ago, that was one of the things where you decide what sort of approach you take for the 404 page. Maybe sometimes you want to have something more whimsical. Sometimes you need something more serious. And committing to one when you can have such a diverse and broad user base can be challenging. With these, it becomes as easy as offering a few different patterns for that template. Then the user will always be able to change the copy and modify something. So again, it opens up a lot of these things that used to be locked down. However, from a theme perspective, I think this doesn&#8217;t reduce the theme at all. If anything, it allows the theme to focus less on coding and functions and more on design expression and aesthetics. I don&#8217;t think that would ever be exhausted. That will always remain as diverse as humans are interacting with WordPress. And so it&#8217;s not that I don&#8217;t see it&#8217;s just as like, typographic and block styles. How do you express a template, how do you express the structure, what choices you quote, what choices you make as a theme builder? And of course, there are many degrees of control there. Because a site maintainer may not want the 404 template to be editable, that sort of control will always be present.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Josepha [19:38]: Yeah. And really fast. I have to add a caveat to a thing that you said in there. For anyone who&#8217;s listening keenly, you may have heard Matías say that the users can update any of the content there &#8211; any of the copy. In this context, we&#8217;re talking about users as in the people who are maintaining the site, not people who are visiting your site. Visitors to your site will not be able to change any copy on your page unless you&#8217;ve done something very interesting with your WordPress site, which is also fine if that&#8217;s what you prefer to do. By default, your visitors can&#8217;t change everything on your website, which is good news, frankly.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I&#8217;ve got one logistics question, which I&#8217;m happy to take. And then one is kind of a big picture question that I also got from Twitter. “What about the classic editor block; what is going to happen to that? And when will we know?” So ages and ages ago, before COVID? I think so. Probably maybe a couple of years ago, Matt said that the classic editor plugin would be supported through the end of 2021. And that is still the case; there will be active support on that through the end of 2021. After that, it will not be actively supported anymore. It won&#8217;t be removed from any place that you can get access to right now. In a “this is the end of its lifecycle” sort of way, we just won&#8217;t have anyone who is currently committed to maintaining that plugin anymore. So that&#8217;s what&#8217;s happening at the end of the year. And yeah, at the end of 2021. The big question that we have is, “why is full site editing being so rushed?” I think this is a bit of a loaded question.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Matías [21:32]: Yeah, I think I think it&#8217;s still a fair question, though. I think we&#8217;re dealing with two things here. And one is ensuring that we release things in the best state possible. And also, some of the urgency is to offer tools that we know that people lack right now and that could really benefit from. Making that determination is very tricky. The full site editing project has been in the works for the last couple of years. If we count the initial phase of Gutenberg, that&#8217;s four to five years. We&#8217;ve been doing many calls for testing, which I think have been super useful to catch issues and reflect as a community on where things are going; how do we integrate with these? How do we use it? What are the shortcomings? What do we need to do? Based on all of these, we&#8217;ll continue to make decisions on when things become ready. We&#8217;re not committed to releasing something that&#8217;s not in a good state. And I think we will always be very careful about that. There are these two competing senses of the urgency &#8211; of getting some of these tools out, and because it also benefits from the feedback loops. I always say that, in many ways, the initial phase of Gutenberg, to me, is not finished. We took the initial two years to do the 5.0 release, the initial block editor, and so on. But, it&#8217;s still being improved at a very fast pace, among all the recent major releases improvements to the editor were included; that will continue to be the case. In many ways, phase one is not finished. And the moment we choose to release some of these tools or editing tools, it won&#8217;t be finished either. They will need to continue to grow, mature, and incorporate a lot of the feedback. Even the things that the ecosystem is building around. I&#8217;ve seen a few themes already that are incorporating a blank canvas template so that you can use them in some pages and take over and do everything with blocks. So even the community and ecosystem as a whole is also sort of paving the way for what needs to come.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Josepha [24:06]: I think from my perspective, and of course, I&#8217;m on the people side of things, the communication side of things, the logistics side of things; I have a frequently a very different view from what a lot of other folks are seeing. And so from my side of things, I have to say, I&#8217;m communicating about this change in a really broad way, which has not been happening since 2019 when we started the work. We&#8217;ve been communicating broadly with the WordPress community, but not with everybody who uses WordPress. So, I think that for a lot of people, this looks like a project that we started really actively working on in the last six months or so. And now we&#8217;re just racing toward a finish line. I think that there&#8217;s, there&#8217;s not been a lot of awareness of everything that&#8217;s gone into it. And so, on the one hand, it feels a little less rushed to me knowing the full length of the history on this. But also, as you said, I really think that this gets a bunch of tools to people who otherwise have not been able to accomplish these things in WordPress or otherwise. I am so anxious to get something to people who really can benefit from this change the most. And it&#8217;s the nature of the open source, right that like, one, as long as you have users, you&#8217;re going to have stuff you have to fix in your software. So we&#8217;re never really, really going to be done with this; there&#8217;s not going to be like a done point of WordPress. And the second thing is, I think it&#8217;s generally true that you don&#8217;t really start getting full user feedback until after you have launched your major release. I think that we see that a lot in open source software; you can bring in as many people as you think you can in your user tests heading up to it. And in your accessibility tests. And, in general, quality assurance tests. You can bring in a lot of people and still not have gotten the full understanding of the various niche use cases that your users will bring to you. Because at this point, we&#8217;re like 40% of the web. And that means that we&#8217;re serving this majority collection of increasingly minority voices and niche voices in the space. And so, a little bit I feel a sense of urgency; I feel a bit of anxiousness about trying to get this out there for one, to get the tools in the hands of the people who can benefit the most from them, but also so that we can start really getting the full stress test of this software out and get that feedback in so that we can really build something responsive to what our users need our long tail, “anyone who ever uses WordPress ever,” definition of users. And so, that&#8217;s why I feel a sense of urgency around it. Even though you know, as I said, you and I have been working on this for like five years, and you&#8217;ve been working on it for a decade or something. I actually don&#8217;t know how long it&#8217;s been worked on.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Matías [27:35]: Now that makes me feel a bit old.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Josepha [27:40]: Nobody makes Matías feel old. He is a lovely, wonderful colleague. Sorry, Matías, If I made you feel old.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Matías [27:46]: No, that&#8217;s totally fine. I also want to add that full site editing is not like a single toggle that&#8217;s going to drop into a major release. So I think that&#8217;s important to consider, I think this entire year is going to see a lot of these tools being, and sometimes the sort of the end-user is not the, again, the site maintainer. Still, you can also be the theme developer; I think there are many tools that would be empowering for theme developers to use. Again, we mentioned there are like five to ten themes, block themes right now. That needs to grow a lot, and that only grows through these sorts of feedback loops. And the theme community pushing things forward and seeing where things can lead to. I&#8217;m very excited about the pattern directory integration because I think that can also combine with blog themes in very powerful ways. Imagine if, I don&#8217;t know many of these patterns that are very common on the web and very needed, that if we can refine them together with a second community and make them available across themes, you can combine a header from one theme with a content of another; all these sorts of mixtures could happen. All of this needs exploration, the creativity of the entire community, and so on. In that sense, getting all these tools, even if it doesn&#8217;t immediately change anything for like the site itself, starts to unlock a lot of things.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Josepha [29:27]: I&#8217;m going to take a bit of your answer from there and tie it all the way back to your first answer that we had when you joined me today. And say, I think you&#8217;re absolutely right. We have a set of users in our theme authors and our plugin developers as well that we desperately need to get looking at this set of tools. I hope that what we are shipping in the first iteration of this serves as an opportunity for all of those theme authors and agency owners, plugin authors, WordPress site configurers freelancers. Like, I really hope that this puts it into a really accessible, easy-to-access space for them so that they can do those experiments based on what they know their users need the most. They are the group that has the closest access to site maintainers. And what they need compared to, for instance, me or a potential you like we have a lot of information, you and I, we do a lot of tests, we have a strong sense of what is needed at the moment, but we don&#8217;t have as a close connection that our theme and agency and plugin folks all have. And so that&#8217;s another part of why I&#8217;m so excited to get this out in the current iteration of it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Josepha [31:04]: That was a lot of questions in a little bit of time. This is going to be officially my longest WordPress briefing. Matías, I am so glad that you were able to join me today. And I think that everyone&#8217;s going to be really, really excited to hear your answers to these questions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Matías [31:23]: Thank you for having me.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Josepha [31:25]: All right, my friends. That brings us into our small list of big things. I&#8217;m going to skip our community highlight today just because we had a slightly longer word press briefing in our bonus iteration today. But the small list of big things. The first thing is WordCamp Central America is coming up on April 15; there is a registration link in the show notes that you can access your tickets with. I recommend that you go; we&#8217;ve got a lot of excellent speakers coming up there and a lot of good content and good training and learning for y&#8217;all. The second thing is that Matt Mullenweg and I have listening hours coming up with the community in the first week of April. I&#8217;ll add the link to register for those in the show notes as well; it&#8217;s just a few minutes for you all to stop by, check-in, see what&#8217;s going on, and share some celebrations or concerns with us.

I&#8217;m your host, Josepha Haden Chomphosy. Here we go!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>All right, so last week, we wrapped up and shipped the WordPress 5.7 release. The release team this time around was smaller than we&#8217;ve had in the last couple of years. By the numbers, it looks really good: 66 enhancements or feature requests went in, 127 bugs were fixed, and seven versions of a Gutenberg plugin were merged and backported. If you use WordPress, you are probably aware that we have new releases throughout the year, but you probably don&#8217;t know much about the release process. There&#8217;s not really a reason to know unless you&#8217;re actively contributing to a release. For those interested in knowing more about how we improve WordPress, this week&#8217;s exploration is for you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We&#8217;re gonna take a look at what goes into WordPress releases and just kind of zoom our way in from the highest level. At the highest level, there are three major WordPress releases a year, plus the minor releases, plus Gutenberg releases. So if you&#8217;re following current WordPress work and future WordPress work, that&#8217;s going to get you to probably around <strong>30 releases a year</strong>. If we zoom in one level to the release itself, a single release of WordPress takes four to five months from start to the day that we ship, and an additional four to six weeks on support and translations, and minor releases after that. If you&#8217;re looking from my vantage point, you&#8217;ll see that WordPress releases have essentially five parts, some of which happen kind of simultaneously.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The first part is planning and includes the project lead, lead developers, design; groups like that. The second phase is the creation phase when we&#8217;re actually building the things that have to go into the CMS that involves the design, core, editor, mobile, and other teams. Then there&#8217;s this phase that I like to refer to as the distribution phase. This is mostly done by the teams that make sure that WordPress is widely distributable; the polyglots team work on translations, accessibility does some work, docs make sure that everything is documented, and training, of course, gets things ready for when we have to be able to tell people how to use the release.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Then there is the fourth phase; I really don&#8217;t think they go sequentially or in a waterfall format. The fourth-ish phase that I include, and that I tend to see, is this extending and iteration phase. It&#8217;s the phase where we see our theme authors and our plugin authors, folks who are doing support, show up and help us to make sure that WordPress is available not only widely but broadly to ensure that their audiences as theme authors and plugin authors are covered in the features that they need based on what they are using WordPress for. The fifth phase is the part of our communication that involves the community team, especially marketing, WordPressTV, and learn.wordpress.org. Basically, anyone who&#8217;s showing up to make sure that we all share what happened in the release, the features that are coming, and how that affects the users is involved in that particular phase. So five big phases of what happens over those four to five months, and then for the month or month and a half afterward.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If we zoom in a bit more on the creation phase, each release has people who lead the work and coordinate contributor efforts during the course of the release. For any given release, hundreds of people contribute and receive credit for moving the WordPress project forward. Okay, hold on a second. Let&#8217;s pump the brakes and zoom in a bit on that. Hundreds of people work on every major release for a project that powers over 40% of the web that feels like a small number. But for the people who process the contributions in preparation for release, it&#8217;s actually pretty substantial. For every release, there is a small team of leaders who asked the hard questions. Is this a usable feature? Does this make WordPress better overall? And, of course, is this ready to ship?&nbsp; Some of those leaders, a smaller subset of even the leaders that we have already, are committers who actually prep and merge patches to the CMS; they don&#8217;t do all the work to create a design or write all the code. This tiny group of people processes hundreds and hundreds of bug fixes, improvements, and enhancements that have been submitted over the course of months and sometimes years. As a side note, that whole process is a little smaller, a little faster in the Gutenberg featured plugin, but the basic parts are still there. Alright, so we&#8217;ve zoomed from the big picture way into some of the finer details, and it really looks like any other project cycle. So now, I&#8217;m going to layer in the filter of open source to that process.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are a couple of things that make building software in an open source environment so different. The first is that the code is readily available. If you have a basic understanding of the languages, you can see the code, learn from it, and make suggestions about improving it. Second, you consider the user a co-developer in the process, which means that as long as people use your product, they will have opinions on what you shipped. This way of iterating improves WordPress and ties back to one of my favorite open source principles. The idea that with many eyes, all bugs are shallow. To me, that means that with enough people looking at a problem, someone is bound to be able to see the solution.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This brings us to our community highlight, the segment where I share a note about contributors who have helped others along the way or a WordPress success story. This week&#8217;s highlight is from Nok in our Bangkok community. When asked to help her find her way into the WordPress community, she said, “@shinichiN who started the WordPress community in Bangkok and encouraged me to contribute, and also @mayukojpn has introduced me to the WP community team to join as a deputy. “ Thank you for sharing those two inspiring people with us. And if you, listener, have any stories that you would like to share of your own WordPress success or people that you have been so grateful to help you find your way in the project, you can feel free to email those to me at <a href=\"mailto:wpbriefing@wordpress.org\">wpbriefing@wordpress.org</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That brings us to our final segment of the WP Briefing, the small list of big things. I only have three things to share with you this week. The first one is that about a week ago, we had our first release of 2021. It was the WordPress 5.7 release, titled Esperanza. If you have not yet seen it, go ahead and update your website or check with your host and make sure that they have updated you if you&#8217;re on a managed host. And then take a listen to the artists that it&#8217;s named after.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The second thing that I want you to keep an eye out for is wordpress.org/news. We are starting a new series of content that gets at the heart of some of Gutenberg’s basic parts; there’s a lot of change coming up in the next few releases of WordPress. And the most important thing to me is that you understand what we&#8217;re trying to change and where those changes are primarily taking place. There will be a couple of tutorials that go up there over the course of the of the next few weeks. The third item on the small list of big things is to remind you of our call for testing. As I mentioned earlier in the podcast, the users of any open source software are the code developers; the software built is supposed to make your life and work easier. When you test things and find interactions that can use a little bit of refinement or features that are not working exactly as expected, it&#8217;s incredibly helpful for us to have that information to always make sure that we&#8217;re solving problems instead of accidentally creating them. If you want to participate in the Current call for testing, you can head over to make.wordpress.org/test. Or, if you&#8217;ve been doing your own testing, you can also submit any bugs you have found in the GitHub repo, which I will share in the show notes below. So that, my friends, is your small list of big things. Thank you for tuning in today for the WordPress briefing. I’m your host, Josepha Haden Chomphosy. I&#8217;ll see you again in a couple of weeks!</p>\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:30:\"com-wordpress:feed-additions:1\";a:1:{s:7:\"post-id\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:4:\"9980\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:4;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:58:\"\n		\n		\n		\n		\n		\n				\n		\n\n					\n										\n					\n		\n		\n\n			\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:4:{s:0:\"\";a:7:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"WordPress 5.7 “Esperanza”\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:45:\"https://wordpress.org/news/2021/03/esperanza/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Tue, 09 Mar 2021 20:52:32 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:8:\"category\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:8:\"Releases\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:34:\"https://wordpress.org/news/?p=9888\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:1:{s:0:\"\";a:1:{s:11:\"isPermaLink\";s:5:\"false\";}}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:355:\"Meet “Esperanza”, the first WordPress release of 2021. “Esperanza” is named in honor of Esperanza Spalding, a modern musical prodigy.

The editor helps you work in a few places you couldn’t before without getting into code or hiring a pro. The controls you use most are right where you need them. Layout changes that should be simple, are even simpler to make.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Now the new editor is easier to use</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Font-size adjustment in more places:</strong>&nbsp;now, font-size controls are right where you need them in the List and Code blocks. No more trekking to another screen to make that single change!</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Reusable blocks:</strong>&nbsp;several enhancements make reusable blocks more stable and easier to use. And now they save automatically with the post when you click the Update button.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Inserter drag-and-drop:</strong>&nbsp;drag blocks and block patterns from the inserter right into your post.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-video\"><video controls src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/5.7/about-57-drag-drop-image.mp4\"></video></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2>You can do more without writing custom code</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Full-height alignment:</strong>&nbsp;have you ever wanted to make a block, like the Cover block, fill the whole window? Now you can.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Buttons block:</strong>&nbsp;now you can choose a vertical or a horizontal layout. And you can set the width of a button to a preset percentage.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Social Icons block:</strong>&nbsp;now you can change the size of the icons.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/s.w.org/images/core/5.7/about-57-cover.jpg?w=632&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2>A simpler default color palette</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>This new streamlined color palette collapses all the colors that used to be in the WordPress source code down to seven core colors and a range of 56 shades that meet the <a href=\"https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG2AA-Conformance\">WCAG 2.0 AA recommended contrast ratio</a> against white or black.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Find the new palette in the default WordPress Dashboard color scheme, and use it when you’re building themes, plugins, or any other components. For all the details,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2021/02/23/standardization-of-wp-admin-colors-in-wordpress-5-7\">check out the Color Palette dev note</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>From HTTP to HTTPS in a single click</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Starting now, switching a site from HTTP to HTTPS is a one-click move. WordPress will automatically update database URLs when you make the switch. No more hunting and guessing!</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>New Robots API</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The new Robots API lets you include the filter directives in the robots meta tag, and the API includes the&nbsp;<code>max-image-preview: large</code>&nbsp;directive by default. That means search engines can show bigger image previews, which can boost your traffic (unless the site is marked&nbsp;<em>not-public</em>).</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Lazy-load your iFrames</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Now it’s simple to let iframes lazy-load. By default, WordPress will add a&nbsp;<code>loading=\"lazy\"</code>&nbsp;attribute to iframe tags when both width and height are specified.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Ongoing cleanup after update to jQuery 3.5.1</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>For years jQuery helped make things move on the screen in ways the basic tools couldn’t—but that keeps changing, and so does jQuery.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In 5.7, jQuery gets more focused and less intrusive, with fewer messages in the console.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Check the Field Guide for more!</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Check out the latest version of the WordPress Field Guide.

is open source software, maintained by a global network of contributors. There are many examples of how WordPress has changed people’s lives for the better. In this monthly series, we share some of the amazing stories that are lesser-known.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>From a natural interest in computers and fixing things as a young woman, Olga Gleckler from St Petersburg, Russia, found WordPress took her on a journey to becoming a successful female tech entrepreneur. On International Women’s Day, we share her story.&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2021/03/WCEU-2020-online.jpg?resize=580%2C768&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"Olga with a WordCamp Vienna t-shirt\" class=\"wp-image-9878\" width=\"580\" height=\"768\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2021/03/WCEU-2020-online.jpg?resize=773%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 773w, https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2021/03/WCEU-2020-online.jpg?resize=226%2C300&amp;ssl=1 226w, https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2021/03/WCEU-2020-online.jpg?resize=768%2C1018&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2021/03/WCEU-2020-online.jpg?resize=1159%2C1536&amp;ssl=1 1159w, https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2021/03/WCEU-2020-online.jpg?resize=1546%2C2048&amp;ssl=1 1546w, https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2021/03/WCEU-2020-online.jpg?w=1932&amp;ssl=1 1932w, https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2021/03/WCEU-2020-online.jpg?w=1264&amp;ssl=1 1264w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 580px) 100vw, 580px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Finding your path can take longer than you expect</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>From the age of 15, Olga found herself under pressure to find a free place for her professional studies. She said: “I didn’t know how high or low my chances were even if I had very good marks. I could have been just the biggest fish in a small pond. But anyway, I made up my mind to go to technical school.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On leaving school in St Petersburg with her certificate, Olga felt her knowledge of opportunities was very narrow. She had pictured being an ecologist or guide translator based on the subjects she had been taught at school. There was also an advertising boom in Russia and she began to explore this as a career avenue. She had developed her computer skills and found opportunities to practise by helping her teachers with administrative work.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Though she did not have access to any formal career advice, her journey led her into programming. She said: “The range of technical schools was not wide. I spent four years studying transistor markings, soldering and drawing PCB layouts. Programming courses using Pascal didn&#8217;t do anything useful with it.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A lack of suitable access to English-language courses made things harder for Olga. She was determined that she would master the language later in her life. In the meantime, she left technical school with an honors degree and improved typing skills.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“I faced it was a wild, unfriendly market. I didn’t know how to recognize a genuine job offer or how to avoid the bad ones. It was difficult and I don’t know how long I would’ve looked for work without help.”</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Think differently to find where you belong</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Olga&#8217;s father worked in an IT company and was able to give her some advice and help with potential introductions. When she was still studying, he suggested her strong technical skills might be useful as a substitute typist. When she finished her studies, he helped her apply for a job updating a legal system on clients’ computers.<br><br>Six months later, she got a full-time job in the same service department. She liked her position and her clients. However, she was given friendly advice that without a university degree she would not be able to have any further promotions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At this time, Olga was trying to study PHP from a book. She found it very exciting at first, but a lot of their functions did not give her explanations on how to build something useful. She found when she tried to build practical items from book reading, it did not always make sense and the solutions would often fail.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She said: “It was hard to admit a failure even to myself and it was nagging me for a long time. I had to choose something I could handle, that I was interested in and could afford. It turned out to be advertising.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She spent most of the family’s holidays on learning sessions during the next six years. Olga recalled: “It was tricky for my husband to make me leave a computer, once I was glued to it, so he bought me my first laptop. English was still hard for me, I got high marks through just memorizing all the words in a textbook and how they should sound.”</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p><strong>Doubting your professional skills can happen when you are at home isolated looking after children. Keeping up your interests is important.</strong></p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Olga’s life took a change after having a new baby and she spent three years doubting her professional skills and her chances of getting a good job. She tried to get back into other interests through studying, baking and drawing, but found ‘the pram was pulling me back’. She found she became very isolated and felt less able to contribute as the family was relying on her husband’s income as she tried to focus on looking forward.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She said: “I was convinced (and saw) that not too many companies wanted a woman in the office, who with a small baby might need lots of leave.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She finished her education when she returned to work after three years caring for her son. She secured a promotion but with changes in the company’s staffing, things were tense. She found the difficulties there had become more heightened and felt that young female colleagues were treated as ‘pieces of furniture’ by one manager. She did not want to stay in this environment and in a few months time decided to leave.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Your next chapter may be nearby</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Determined to not repeat this type of experience, Olga looked at the brighter side. She said: “I wanted to be a marketer. Knowing how tricky it is to sell intangibles, I wanted a solid product to work with.”&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It turned out to be more difficult to find a job outside traditional IT as a young mother. Some human resource officers advised her to remain within the technology arena.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Olga remained hopeful and continued to study hard. She had many learning experiences along the way, which she hopes others can learn from too. One was setting a low bar to employers. She said: “Companies I worked in wanted to get all publicity and sales increases achieved through deductions from my salary.” This happened once and the next time she was in this situation she asked specifically about the budget before signing up. &#8220;I was assured this would not be the case, but again I found the budget for publicity came out of my wages. It was a tough period of disappointments. So when I was offered a part-time administrative job with basic sick leave, I took it gladly as a reprieve.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The job was far from home and involved a lot of travelling. Olga spent two to three hours a day on buses with Harry Potter audio books for company. “In these traffic jams, I started to feel English at last and loved it. It gave me a freedom no money can buy. Life was getting better.” </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Though the job did not pay highly, it gave her something valuable &#8211; a working website. After her boss and the developer parted company, she was asked to maintain the site. Through some studying and reverse engineering, she discovered how it worked and it gave her an insight into how to write simple websites from scratch.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Olga’s first encounter with JavaScript wasn’t easy: “My first JavaScript calculator almost made me crazy, but I pursued it.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Quickly she started to get small tasks from friends and relatives, usually to solve some urgent problems and started to meet popular content management systems. One of the first she met with was WordPress. There was an issue in a website theme used by a website which had been changed and not maintained. It took a whole weekend to solve, but she was determined to work it out. Back then, WordPress was ‘just a system’. She didn’t know then how much it was to become part of her life.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Olga spent the next two years in this role. As time went on, she started to feel worried and less satisfied with the work. The last straw for her was a negative statement from her boss, who was not a programmer and who hadn’t seen any of the work done on the website. She felt the approach was unfair as she had done extensive work on the site. She recalls: “I became angry, but it was exactly what I needed to move jobs.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When Olga was job hunting, she didn&#8217;t feel she had the courage to apply for a developer’s role, despite the learning and work she had already done. So instead she started working on projects where she felt she was more like a ‘seller of box-ready websites’. It was another tough half a year for her with a lot of work, low payment and plans not turning out as she had hoped. On top of long hours, she ended up with pneumonia. She said: “I see now that I was doing a disservice to customers, websites are not a microwave meal &#8211; quick, cheap and dummy. There was no life in the sites without a lot of work which no one was willing to buy. Most of the sites I sold back then died after the first year and they never were truly alive and useful.”</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>You need to be brave and have courage</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2021/03/Berlin-2019.jpg?resize=632%2C422&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"Olga in Berlin wearing the WordPress Code is Poetry lanyard and a WordCamp t-shirt\" class=\"wp-image-9879\" width=\"632\" height=\"422\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2021/03/Berlin-2019.jpg?resize=1024%2C684&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2021/03/Berlin-2019.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2021/03/Berlin-2019.jpg?resize=768%2C513&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2021/03/Berlin-2019.jpg?resize=1536%2C1025&amp;ssl=1 1536w, https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2021/03/Berlin-2019.jpg?w=2048&amp;ssl=1 2048w, https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2021/03/Berlin-2019.jpg?w=1264&amp;ssl=1 1264w, https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2021/03/Berlin-2019.jpg?w=1896&amp;ssl=1 1896w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 632px) 100vw, 632px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Olga really wanted a developer job but seeking jobs of this type was very frustrating. From the job adverts she found, it felt like most IT companies were asking for geniuses who already knew a lot of technologies and frameworks. She found this very demotivating.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She then found a job offer on a website outside the most popular job portals  and it seemed like a perfect fit. They wanted someone with experience to write from scratch, understand someone else’s code and maintain it, with an ability to translate technical documentation and articles, and make simple designs for printing products. After completing a trial task, she was taken on, and enjoyed a better salary, in a calm environment with good colleagues and without the requirement for a lot of extra hours.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The advert turned out to be a direct ad from one of the sales departments in a technology company. By succeeding in the  task set, Olga had bypassed the Human Resources team which she felt&nbsp;would not normally have considered her.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Her boss agreed to her working remotely most of the time. It solved any potential leave problems which Olga had thought may be an obstacle.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For Olga it had been 14 years since the original decision to become a programmer and it was only the beginning.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>After a few years at what she describes as an ‘amazing experience’ in this workplace, Olga felt able to move on to her next challenge as a developer.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Decision-making can benefit from wider knowledge</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>After working with different systems Olga became sure that WordPress is the best CMS for developers and clients. But she was disappointed to find that the ease of use meant that good code was not always a priority for some of the sites she looked at.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“The biggest flaw of WordPress &#8211; it’s so easy to make things work that some may feel they don’t need to bother to do things right, but this becomes a problem later.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In custom themes for a site, she also saw sites being made and clients left without any further support, or items hard coded when clients actually needed more control to change regularly.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Olga used to rely on examples she could easily find, documentation and search engines to improve her understanding in using WordPress. She discovered that just by searching for a specific feature or a solution, you can miss the whole picture.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She turned to online courses to get more comprehensive knowledge and then started to attend WordPress events, firstly online and then by foot, trains and planes! She discovered a worldwide community that was very much alive. She didn’t know when she started studying online materials and attending discussions that she would end up contributing herself to the <a href=\"https://learn.wordpress.org/\">Learn WordPress</a> platform a few years later.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>WordCamps and contributor days became a big part of her life. From her early days attending events and starting out contributing to WordPress, she is an active member of the WordPress.org Global Marketing and Polyglots Teams, and supported the recent WordPress release. She is just beginning her first WordCamp organiser experience, joining WordCamp Europe 2021 on the Contribute Team. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2021/03/St-Petersburg-2018.jpg?resize=632%2C602&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"Olga next to a banner of WordCamp St Petersburg 2018\" class=\"wp-image-9883\" width=\"632\" height=\"602\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2021/03/St-Petersburg-2018.jpg?resize=1024%2C976&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2021/03/St-Petersburg-2018.jpg?resize=300%2C286&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2021/03/St-Petersburg-2018.jpg?resize=768%2C732&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2021/03/St-Petersburg-2018.jpg?resize=1536%2C1464&amp;ssl=1 1536w, https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2021/03/St-Petersburg-2018.jpg?resize=2048%2C1951&amp;ssl=1 2048w, https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2021/03/St-Petersburg-2018.jpg?w=1264&amp;ssl=1 1264w, https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2021/03/St-Petersburg-2018.jpg?w=1896&amp;ssl=1 1896w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 632px) 100vw, 632px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Olga said: “Through the wider WordPress community, I knew not only where to look but also whom to ask. Most importantly, I found allies who don’t think I’m going crazy by speaking with delight about work, and with whom I share a passion and fondness for WordPress. This is what matters.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Now, after more than seven years of full time development, I am still enjoying endless learning, frequent discoveries, mistakes and an impassioned wish to do better.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This and a desire to help others use WordPress.org is part of Olga’s continued contribution to its Support and Marketing Teams, and led her to be involved in the Release Marketing questions and answers in 2020.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>There is no chequered flag on the way</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"632\" height=\"946\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2021/03/Berlin-2019-1.jpg?resize=632%2C946&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"Olga at WordCamp Europe in Berlin in 2019\" class=\"wp-image-9881\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2021/03/Berlin-2019-1.jpg?resize=684%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 684w, https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2021/03/Berlin-2019-1.jpg?resize=200%2C300&amp;ssl=1 200w, https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2021/03/Berlin-2019-1.jpg?resize=768%2C1151&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2021/03/Berlin-2019-1.jpg?resize=1025%2C1536&amp;ssl=1 1025w, https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2021/03/Berlin-2019-1.jpg?w=1367&amp;ssl=1 1367w, https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2021/03/Berlin-2019-1.jpg?w=1264&amp;ssl=1 1264w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 632px) 100vw, 632px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The road to freedom and becoming her own boss has not been easy for Olga. It is the path that got her where she is today, and she continues to find joy in it. She retains the lessons she’s learned and is always hungry to learn more.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&nbsp;“I travelled through a very uneven path, with a lot of obstacles and noise, but for me it’s like a kaleidoscope where a little turn presents a new picture, a new “ah-ha” moment, new excitement after seemingly pointless efforts.”&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She added: “When in doubt I remind myself about David Ogilvy (generally considered the Founding Father of the modern advertising industry) who tried a lot of things before he struck gold with advertising, and maybe that’s why he did.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Finally, she learned not only to keep a good spirit and try different things, but also to dare as you move forward.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Contributors</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Thanks to Abha Thakor (<a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/webcommsat/\">@webcommsat</a>), Nalini Thakor (<a href=\'https://profiles.wordpress.org/nalininonstopnewsuk/\' class=\'mention\'><span class=\'mentions-prefix\'>@</span>nalininonstopnewsuk</a>), Larissa Murillo (<a href=\'https://profiles.wordpress.org/lmurillom/\' class=\'mention\'><span class=\'mentions-prefix\'>@</span>lmurillom</a>), Meher Bala (<a href=\'https://profiles.wordpress.org/meher/\' class=\'mention\'><span class=\'mentions-prefix\'>@</span>meher</a>), Josepha Haden (<a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/chanthaboune/\">@chanthaboune</a>), Chloé Bringmann (<a href=\'https://profiles.wordpress.org/cbringmann/\' class=\'mention\'><span class=\'mentions-prefix\'>@</span>cbringmann</a>) and Topher DeRosia (<a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/topher1kenobe/\">@topher1kenobe</a>).

I&#8217;m your host, Josepha Haden Chomphosy. Here we go!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;ve been asked many times what the day-to-day work looks like for the Executive Director of the WordPress project. I don&#8217;t really think I&#8217;ve done a great job of answering that question. My default answer is either too broad, and I say, “I helped turn the WordPress vision into reality by supporting the community of contributors,” or way too narrow, and I start telling people what&#8217;s on my calendar. Probably no one cares about each entry on my calendar, and almost every contributor is covered by “I get things done by helping people.” So today, I invite you to join me in exploring the type of work required and the balance it takes to keep WordPress working.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>First, some context on the weekly activity I see in WordPress, on average, 1,800 to 2,000 contributors a week, participate in conversations and tickets across the entire WordPress project in our entire ecosystem. There are about 20 volunteer teams that are each led by two to three team reps. Each of those teams actually has smaller groups that work on specific things; all told, it&#8217;s probably about 50 distinct teams. And probably quite a few more if you are very generous in your counting about what makes up a team for us.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Among those teams, a minimum of about 35 meetings a week are held, plus more for working groups. That doesn&#8217;t take into account the things most people are aware of externally.&nbsp; It doesn&#8217;t take into account the big quarterly or annual activity things like WordPress software releases or any of our events. When those sorts of things do happen, there&#8217;s a bit of an increase in our activity.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&nbsp;I work 40 to 60 hours a week on WordPress, depending on what&#8217;s going on, to make sure that I know what&#8217;s happening now; so that I have insight into what the next three to five years will bring. All of that is in support of <strong>the WordPress community, which I define as anyone who has ever interacted with WordPress ever</strong>, regardless of whether they know it or not. In case you&#8217;re feeling a bit lost right now, we can shorthand that entire context as this is really big and really complex.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Given that giant scope, it makes sense that people wonder what the work looks like. So I&#8217;ll talk about it in three big chunks: what I focus my time on, what I focus my attention on, and what helps me balance my decisions.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So first, what I focus my time on. I spend about a quarter of my time in meetings, mostly with current contributors, project leadership, and community members. I spend another quarter of my time in WordPress community outreach, checking in with current folks, reaching out to future WordPressers, and checking in with people that I haven&#8217;t heard from in a long time to make sure that I know what they need and if there&#8217;s anything that I can do to help. After that, I spend a bit under 15% of my time each on writing/communications work or ad hoc project work. I then spend 10% of my time reviewing proposals, editing, communication drafts for others, and determining my stances on discussions that we&#8217;re having in tickets and elsewhere. I spend all of my remaining time planning for various goals, projects, initiatives and personally working to remove blockers for our volunteer contributors. So the bulk of my time, about 50% or more, is spent in calls with people, which makes sense if you&#8217;ve ever worked with me; personal connections with the community have been the best part of my job for a long time. Since the community is what makes WordPress so great, it&#8217;s only natural that I want to stay connected.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The second big chunk is what I focus my attention on. I pay attention to four big pillars of work in the project. The first one is the WordPress CMS itself. So that&#8217;s the core team, accessibility, design, and many, many others. The second one is the WordPress community. And that&#8217;s the training team, everybody who is working on the Learn initiative, and the actual community team as well.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The third big pillar that I focus on is the WordPress contributor experience, which is mostly the meta team but&nbsp; includes all of the teams they work with: plugins, themes, polyglots, etc. The fourth big pillar that I turn my attention to is our communication; what I am saying about the WordPress project to people outside of it and what I am helping our team reps to say about the work that we&#8217;re accomplishing for the WordPress project inside the project. In general, we have to make sure that we coordinate a big group of contributors around a common idea or a common practice as we move forward.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now, the way I focus both my time and attention probably isn&#8217;t quite right if you&#8217;re focused on a single feature or team. And it&#8217;s definitely not right if you aren&#8217;t spending 40 hours a week in the project; what that probably looks like for you is more like an hour in a team meeting, 30 minutes or so on clarifying conversations, and any remaining time that you are able to contribute focused on the feature that you&#8217;re actually contributing to. And so, there you have it all my time and attention. That is WordPress in a nutshell.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This brings us to the third chunk, the balance part. You might be wondering, how do I make sure I am fair and balanced in decisions that I have to make. That is something that I think about all the time, and I take very seriously. It&#8217;s hard to make decisions that might affect 2,000 people. It&#8217;s even harder when those decisions might affect 40% of the web. I know that I don&#8217;t have all the answers. And I&#8217;m fortunate enough to have 50 or 60 people in the community who offer me advice and guidance every single week. I&#8217;m in constant contact with the project lead, of course, but I also prioritize messages and concerns raised from team reps. And I always strive to understand before I try to problem solve. I don&#8217;t always get it right, but I do always work to get better. And that is the day-to-day work of a WordPress executive director.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That brings us to our community highlight. I tweeted out into the community asking for excellent examples of Freelancer success stories, and today I&#8217;m going to share a story from <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/ideag/\">Arūnas Liuiza</a>. Their story goes like this:&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">“For almost a decade, freelance WordPress gigs allowed me to support myself and my family and keep my full-time teaching position at the local college, which was paying peanuts but was an awesome, meaningful, and fulfilling. I am sincerely grateful for that.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That brings us to our final segment of this brief podcast. The small list of big things to keep an eye out for in the next two weeks in WordPress. I only have two things this week. The first one is daylight saving time. It is that time of year where daylight saving time starts or stops at various parts in the globe. If you are a team rep here at WordPress, don&#8217;t forget to talk to your teams in your meetings in the next few weeks to decide what you&#8217;re going to do. You can move your team meeting if you want, and you can keep it where it is and see what new voices show up when it moves around for various people. Either way, make sure that you chat it out with your team and make sure that everybody understands what is and isn&#8217;t moving on your calendar. That will also be relevant to any of our brand new work-from-home folks in the middle of this global pandemic.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The second thing to share is that there is a major release of WordPress coming up that&#8217;s going to happen on March 9th. It’s WordPress 5.7; it&#8217;s going to be a good release. We&#8217;ve been working on it since December or maybe a little bit earlier. So keep an eye out for announcements about that here on wordpress.org/news, or if you want to follow more about the developer details and the process details you can head on over to wordpress.org/core. That, my friends, is your small list of big things. Thank you for tuning in today for the WordPress briefing. I’m your host, Josepha Haden Chomphosy. I&#8217;ll see you again in a couple of weeks!</p>\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:30:\"com-wordpress:feed-additions:1\";a:1:{s:7:\"post-id\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:4:\"9825\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:9;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:72:\"\n		\n		\n		\n		\n		\n				\n		\n		\n		\n\n					\n										\n					\n		\n		\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n			\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:4:{s:0:\"\";a:7:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:35:\"Did

Gutenberg) comes with a feature called &#8220;reusable blocks.” They are blocks, saved for later, edited in one place.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Have you ever wanted to:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Re-use the same snippet of text across posts and pages?</li><li>Save complex layouts to spare you having to copy/paste from one post to another?</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Reusable blocks can do these things.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Like templates, you mean?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Not quite. Think of reusable blocks as snippets of globally synchronized content that are personal to you. You can edit all your reusable blocks in one place, and any post or page you inserted that block into, get the updated version as well.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Where you might use templates to structure your website, you can use reusable blocks to structure your content. For example:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>A testimonial on your homepage and your product page.</li><li>A &#8220;this post is part of a series&#8221; box that you insert part-way through your article.</li><li>A &#8220;Follow me on social media&#8221; section you can weave into the prose of your popular article.</li><li>Complex but static blocks, such as a &#8220;Subscribe to my newsletter&#8221; box, a contact form, a survey, quiz, or polls.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Key properties are that reusable blocks are unbeatable when you want to reuse a snippet of content, edit it in one place, and have the changes propagate to every instance.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Show me how</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>To create a reusable block, open the block editor and create the content you want to reuse:</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-video\"><video controls src=\"https://wordpress.org/news/files/2021/02/1_create_content.mov\"></video></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Now select the content you want to turn into a reusable block, then click the three-dot &#8220;More&#8221; menu and choose &#8220;Add to Reusable blocks.”</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-video\"><video controls src=\"https://wordpress.org/news/files/2021/02/2_convert_to_reusable.mov\"></video></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Voilà, you’ve now created a reusable block. From now on, you can find this block, and any other you create, in the &#8220;Reusable blocks&#8221; tab in the block library:</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-video\"><video controls src=\"https://wordpress.org/news/files/2021/02/3_reusable_blocks_tab.mov\"></video></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>This is also where you can insert the newly created block on any of your posts or pages.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Where do I edit my existing reusable blocks?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>To edit a reusable block, select it and make your edits. When you make an edit, the Publish button will have a little dot indicator:</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-video\"><video controls src=\"https://wordpress.org/news/files/2021/02/4_saving_global_changes.mov\"></video></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>This dot indicates you’ve made a global change that potentially affects posts beyond just the one you’re editing, the same as when you’re editing templates. This lets you confirm the change was intentional.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Another way to edit your reusable blocks</strong> is to click the global three-dot &#8220;More&#8221; menu and selecting &#8220;Manage all reusable blocks&#8221;:</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-video\"><video controls src=\"https://wordpress.org/news/files/2021/02/5_manage_all_reusable_blocks.mov\"></video></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>This takes you to a section letting you edit, rename, export, or delete every reusable block you created.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>What else can I do?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Here are a couple of tips and tricks you can leverage to get the most out of reusable blocks.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Give them a good name</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>When you name a reusable block, you are essentially choosing your search terms, as the name is what you search for in the block library (or when you use the &#8220;slash command,” typing / in an empty paragraph):</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-video\"><video controls src=\"https://wordpress.org/news/files/2021/02/6_tip_name_them.mov\"></video></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Avoid names such as &#8220;Gallery&#8221; or &#8220;Image,” as that’ll be annoying when you just want to insert one of those. You can avoid that with a unique name, such as &#8220;My author biography.”</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Insert in the best place of your content flow</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>One obvious benefit of reusable blocks is that they are just blocks, just like everything else in the block editor. That means you can insert it anywhere in your content. You might want your rich author biography to sit at the top or bottom of the post, but <em>This post is part of a series</em> box that might sit well two or three paragraphs not to disrupt the reading flow.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-video\"><video controls src=\"https://wordpress.org/news/files/2021/02/7_tip_place_in_flow.mov\"></video></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>A design shortcut</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Maybe you created a complex layout you&#8217;re happy with, a call to action with the right image and buttons, and it took a while to get it just right. Go on and save it as a reusable block: even if you mean to insert it only to convert it to a regular block, it might still save you a minute.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To convert a reusable block to regular (blocks, select it and click the &#8220;Convert to regular blocks&#8221;:</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-video\"><video controls src=\"https://wordpress.org/news/files/2021/02/10_complex_layouts-2.mov\"></video></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Design by </em><a href=\"https://beatrizfialho.com/\"><em>Beatriz Fialho</em></a><em>.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Tip:</strong> You can also find some nice patterns on <a href=\"https://gutenberghub.com/\">Gutenberg Hub</a> or <a href=\"https://shareablock.com/\">ShareABlock</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Take it with you</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Need to move to another site? You can both export and import reusable blocks.

Recipients were puzzled, because it appeared the company was wasting its marketing budget on people who were not likely to be swayed by the campaign. Wix seems oblivious to the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/danyork/status/1379128016387866624\">negative </a><a href=\"https://twitter.com/wesbos/status/1379570402347864066\">responses</a> to its headphones marketing ploy.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Like, these are nice headphones, but I want to know if there is a proprietary CMS that is willing to pay to replace the outdoor condenser thing for my A/C within the next 12 months or not before making my decision.</p>&mdash; Josh Pollock (@Josh412) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Josh412/status/1379470244968857600?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">April 6, 2021</a></blockquote>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p>Subsequent advertisements in this new &ldquo;You Deserve Better&rdquo; campaign are markedly more negative than the <a href=\"https://www.secret-update.com/from-wp\">launch video</a> sent to recipients of the headphones, packed with tasteless and tired motifs. </p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><img /></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Wix representative Maya Gril said the campaign is part of the company&rsquo;s &ldquo;initiative to connect with an audience that doesn&rsquo;t think or know that Wix applies to their needs.&rdquo; </p>\n\n\n\n<p>When asked what message they are intending to send with the videos, Gril likened using WordPress to being stuck in a bad relationship.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;The campaign shows in a clever way that WordPress users don&rsquo;t need to be stuck in a bad relationship with their platform and they should consider the alternative which allows them to focus on their actual work,&rdquo; Gril said. &ldquo;Each video in the campaign revolves around user pain points, which also highlight Wix&rsquo;s strengths.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Morten Rand-Hendriksen, who received a pair of the headphones, characterized the campaign as &ldquo;<a href=\"https://twitter.com/mor10/status/1379513577619394563\">nuclear troll-marketing</a>.&rdquo; Instead of emphasizing any new, innovative features of the Wix platform, the ads come across as short, petulant narratives with no clear objective. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;I guess they&rsquo;re trying to provoke us into responding?&rdquo; WordPress co-founder Matt Mullenweg <a href=\"https://twitter.com/photomatt/status/1379217014472896512\">tweeted</a> in response to discussion on the campaign. &ldquo;I agree it comes off as creepy and misleading to impersonate &lsquo;WordPress&rsquo; this way.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t tell if trying to get a cease and desist letter is part of their strategy to try and drum up press. Unethical, tacky behavior from an unethical, tacky company. Good reminder: I really appreciate the integrity, principles, and ethics of WordPress ecosystem companies.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Wix&rsquo;s new video ads seem more geared at professional developers with references that are likely outside of regular users&rsquo; experience with the software. The company may have failed to attract professionals in the past, which might explain why it opted to send thousands of dollars worth of headphones to influential WordPress users who fall within that demographic. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2019, Wix began shifting its marketing budget away from TV advertisements and added products that targeted agencies, developers, and designers. The company spent $55 million in marketing in the first quarter of 2019, according to reports shared with <a href=\"https://digiday.com/marketing/wix-com-using-linkedin-target-designers-engineers-agencies/\">Digiday</a>. Wix became more active on LinkedIn&nbsp;and Twitter in pursuit of professionals who would bring more customers to its platform.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;We want to make it clear that we have everything a professional needs,&rdquo; Maya Gril said. &ldquo;Our product is mature and constantly evolving. We&rsquo;re broadening our target audience and we want all new, existing and prospective users to know that Wix is the ultimate web creation platform to help them create, manage and grow online.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Unfortunately, Wix is lacking one very important feature for catering to &ldquo;professional needs&rdquo; &ndash; data portability.  When asked for his thoughts on the campaign, Mullenweg added that Wix is the only CMS in the world that doesn&rsquo;t allow export &ndash; even Facebook does. The <a href=\"https://support.wix.com/en/article/exporting-or-embedding-your-wix-site-elsewhere\">Wix support center</a> states: Y<em>our Wix site and all of its content is&nbsp;<a href=\"https://support.wix.com/en/article/wix-site-hosting\">hosted</a>&nbsp;exclusively on Wix&rsquo;s servers, and cannot be exported elsewhere.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Having content that is locked in and cannot be easily exported to other platforms or hosts does not appeal to professionals. No amount of extravagant spending on marketing stunts will convince developers to bring their customers to a proprietary CMS that also locks in your content. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is why their marketing doesn&rsquo;t appeal to the group of people who received the headphones. Many of them build WordPress as long-time contributors or run WordPress product businesses. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Wix fundamentally misunderstands why people use WordPress and what makes them stay. It&rsquo;s for reasons not found in their overly simplified list of differentiators played out in the new video ads. The desperate marketing tactics, which are geared more towards developers and power users, serve only to reinforce the platform&rsquo;s underdog status and lack of market awareness.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 07 Apr 2021 07:10:46 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:1;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:69:\"WPTavern: Twentig Now Upgrades the Twenty Twenty-One Theme Experience\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:30:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=114785\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:183:\"https://wptavern.com/twentig-now-upgrades-the-twenty-twenty-one-theme-experience?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=twentig-now-upgrades-the-twenty-twenty-one-theme-experience\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:6098:\"<p class=\"has-drop-cap\">Twentig, the brainchild of sibling co-founders Diane and Yann Collet, now supports the Twenty Twenty-One theme. The developers originally built the plugin, which is <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/twentig/\">hosted on WordPress.org</a>, around the idea of &ldquo;supercharging&rdquo; Twenty Twenty. After its initial success, they have turned their sights onto the most recent default theme, adding a slew of new features over the past few months.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The plugin still supports Twenty Twenty. It has merely added features for the latest default theme to its repertoire. The duo behind the plugin does not plan to stop there either.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;Yes, we&rsquo;ll definitively continue this with the future default themes,&rdquo; said Yann Collet. &ldquo;It will be exciting to see what we can do with Full Site Editing and the next block-based theme. With FSE coming, the opportunity is immense, making us confident that we can help people building better websites.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When I <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/supercharge-the-default-wordpress-theme-with-twentig-a-toolbox-for-twenty-twenty\">last covered it</a>, Twentig had a mere 4,000 active installations. All 34 of its reviews were five stars. Today, the plugin has accumulated over 10,000 installs and 75 five-star reviews. It did garner its first four-star rating, bringing the average down a tad. Nevertheless, its user base clearly loves what the plugin developers are doing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The team has created 10 <a href=\"https://twentig.com/demos/\">website demos</a> and 8 single-page examples for inspiration, each on top of the Twenty Twenty-One theme.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li class=\"blocks-gallery-item\"><img />Orlando</li><li class=\"blocks-gallery-item\"><img />Kyoto</li><li class=\"blocks-gallery-item\"><img />Letuce</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the great things about the plugin is that it essentially treats the default themes as a bit of a foundation, a framework. Users do not have to search around for a new theme when they tire of their current look. They can simply mix things up with Twentig.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;The goal is to showcase the power and flexibility of Twentig, the default theme, and the block editor,&rdquo; said the team. &ldquo;And ultimately inspire people to be creative with blocks. It&rsquo;s incredibly fun and fast to build directly inside the block editor with our block patterns instead of using a prototyping tool like Figma.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Extending the Block Editor</h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-drop-cap\">The Twentig plugin&rsquo;s strength is in how it extends the block editor. Users are first presented with a custom sidebar panel with a plethora of patterns and full-page layouts. The plugin then further provides options for individual blocks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Unlike many other block-related plugins, Twentig does not register its own blocks. It uses the core WordPress blocks, except for Contact Form 7 integration, by mixing and matching them in various ways. If a user needs a call-to-action section, the plugin offers 11 patterns. If a user wants to spruce up their galleries, they have plenty of choices.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />Inserting a single page layout.\n\n\n\n<p>The plugin&rsquo;s page layouts and patterns all work with both the Twenty Twenty and Twenty Twenty-One themes. Since Twentig relies primarily on core blocks, it is just a matter of making sure its custom CSS works.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some blocks get an extra setting or two through the plugin. However, the bulk of customization options happen through the Twentig &ldquo;CSS Library.&rdquo; This is a setting under the Advanced tab for most blocks that users can access by clicking the &ldquo;+&rdquo; icon next to the Additional CSS Classes option. It allows users to tick off checkboxes for numerous classes &mdash; each has an explanation of what it does. These are merely a set of utilities that change the block&rsquo;s output in some way.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />Picking Heading block classes via the Twentig CSS Library.\n\n\n\n<p>Twentig&rsquo;s CSS classes system follows the road paved by utility class frameworks like Tailwind. WordPress does a little of this but does not take a holistic approach to it. I have argued that WordPress <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/themes-of-the-future-a-design-framework-and-a-master-theme\">should build a design framework</a> in the past. A standardized class system would play well with block options, giving the development team a foundation for creating a better user experience across themes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The drawback is that the two extra stylesheets on top of Twenty Twenty-One&rsquo;s CSS add a bit of heft to the page. This could give pause to users who want to keep things lightweight. However, it has a smaller footprint than when using it with the older Twenty Twenty.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Customizer Options and More</h2>\n\n\n\n<img />Customizing Twenty Twenty-One&rsquo;s design.\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-drop-cap\">The plugin packages dozens of settings under the &ldquo;Twentig Options&rdquo; customizer panel. It also extends other sections, such as adding more color options. Users who care more about modifying the overall design than blocks will find nearly anything they need to put their own spin on their sites.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Everything from fonts to site layouts to what post metadata to show is covered. Users can also switch between stacked and grid-style blog posts designs while further customizing based on their choices.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The biggest downside to the plugin&rsquo;s customizer integration is that it does not utilize the live preview functionality with most of its options. Making a change means a frame refresh to see its effects.

WordPress contributor Aaron Campbell found it off-putting. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;The video takes some odd snipes at WordPress, but the whole overall feel is a bit shady/dirty. Not a great look for Wix in my opinion,&rdquo; Campbell said after receiving the headphones in the mail. &ldquo;I think I&rsquo;d be fine with it if it weren&rsquo;t signed as &lsquo;From WP&rsquo; and &lsquo;Yours, WP.&rsquo; By the time I got to watching the video I already had that bad taste in my mouth.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some speculated that it may be the first act in a strange marketing saga of Wix targeting WordPress. Others were inadvertently convinced the headphones were actually from WordPress, since the advertisement uses WordPress&rsquo; trademark in the video. This may be a violation of the WordPress Foundation&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://wordpressfoundation.org/trademark-policy/\">trademark policy</a>, but this has not yet been confirmed.

Instead of complying with the GPL, Wix responded by <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/wix-removes-gpl-licensed-wordpress-code-from-mobile-app-forks-original-mit-library\">removing the GPL-licensed code</a> and forking the original MIT-licensed library that the WordPress mobile app code was built upon.

Since that time, Squarespace has grown to overtake Wix, pushing the CMS back into 5th place with 2.4% of the market. It&rsquo;s only natural that Wix would want to target WordPress, the market leader at 40.9%. However, the strategy of misrepresenting WordPress, while sending headphones to influential users and contributors, was perplexing and unsavory. Wix has not yet responded to my request for comment on its new marketing campaign.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Tue, 06 Apr 2021 06:09:31 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:3;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:88:\"WPTavern: The Michelle WordPress Theme Launches With Dozens of Block Patterns and Styles\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:30:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=114708\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:221:\"https://wptavern.com/the-michelle-wordpress-theme-launches-with-dozens-of-block-patterns-and-styles?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=the-michelle-wordpress-theme-launches-with-dozens-of-block-patterns-and-styles\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:6534:\"<p class=\"has-drop-cap\">Oliver Juhas recently released his sixth theme to the WordPress community for free. <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/themes/michelle/\">Michelle</a> is a block-ready theme. However, it also supports Beaver Builder, Elementor, and other page-building plugins.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is a multipurpose theme, which is often an immediate turn-off for me. I prefer to see a purpose-driven design with a unique take on a niche. However, it is hard not to love the personality of Michelle. Juhas did not shy away from putting his brand of styling on the project, which is evident in his past <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/themes/author/webmandesign/\">free themes</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Juhas is marketing Michelle as an accessibility-ready theme. However, it has yet to receive an accessibility review for the theme directory, which would allow it to be tagged as such. From a quick scan for common issues, everything seems to be in order. It will likely pass its review like some of his past free themes. And, &ldquo;inclusive, disabilities friendly, and barrierless&rdquo; are at the forefront of his branding for <a href=\"https://www.webmandesign.eu/\">WebMan Design</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As has become common for block-ready themes, Michelle packages a &ldquo;Content Only&rdquo; template. This is a post/page template that allows end-users to use the block editor as a page builder by not displaying anything other than the post content.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The theme is yet another showcase of what is possible with the block editor. A couple of weeks after Anders Nor&eacute;n&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/eksell-portfolio-theme-now-available-in-wordpress-themes-directory\">Eksell landed in the directory</a>, Juhas has presented the community with another quality theme. The two are entirely different in style and approach, but they both make the block system shine in their own ways.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />Portfolio designed using multiple blocks.\n\n\n\n<p>Users can read more about the theme and peruse several demos via the <a href=\"https://www.webmandesign.eu/portfolio/michelle-wordpress-theme/\">theme&rsquo;s official page</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Block Patterns and Styles</h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-drop-cap\">Michelle may be the only free theme in existence with 67 patterns. And, no, you did not misread that. It literally registers 67 block patterns. Yeah, that is a lot.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It has a little bit of everything. From team galleries to logos, from hero headers to contact cards, it is hard not to find something you need. There was no way that I could realistically test all of them. However, for the dozen or so that I did try, they worked well and offered an easy one-click option for end-users.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />Variable gallery with description pattern.\n\n\n\n<p>I always knew the day would come when a theme author would push the limits on the number of patterns it should offer. While 67 seems a bit excessive, I know from experience that we will see a day when patterns number in the 100s.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I hate to continue beating a dead horse, but WordPress needs to use an <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/proposal-to-create-an-expanded-view-or-overlay-for-the-block-patterns-inserter\">overlay system for block patterns</a>, at least for desktop users. Michelle makes it more apparent than ever that a small slide-out panel will not cut it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If the theme&rsquo;s array of patterns is not enough to whet users&rsquo; appetites, its two dozen block styles just might.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />Hiding a Heading block for everyone but screen-readers.\n\n\n\n<p>The options range from light and dark text shadows to variable galleries. It even has an &ldquo;accessibly hidden&rdquo; style for Heading blocks, which hides the text from the screen but makes it available to screen readers.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Block-Ready Footer and 404 Page</h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-drop-cap\">The theme allows end-users to build their footer and 404 error pages via the block system. Considering that the site editor is not available yet and the block editor is limited to post content, Juhas had to think outside the box a little to make this possible. He made use of the reusable blocks system. This is the sort of ingenuity that happens when theme authors are not burdened by too many rules.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the customizer, users can select the Theme Options &gt; Content section. From there, they are directed to pick a reusable block for their footer and 404 pages. Or they can simply opt out of it. The customizer section also links to the semi-secret admin page to create reusable blocks.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />Select reusable blocks for the 404 and footer content.\n\n\n\n<p>In the past, I have used a similar technique for 404 views. Instead of going the reusable block route, theme users could select a private page. Either option is acceptable for allowing users to modify content they may not have been able to customize in the past.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Starter Content</h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-drop-cap\">Michelle makes extensive use of the WordPress starter content feature. This allows new WordPress users to see what their site could look like with pre-loaded content. The theme creates Home, About, Blog, Services, FAQ, and Contact pages.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />Homepage starter content.\n\n\n\n<p>The feature has languished in recent years. Many theme authors had hoped they would eventually be able to use the feature for non-new installs too. However, Helen Hou-Sand&iacute; <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-to-combine-its-long-neglected-theme-previewer-with-starter-content\">got the ball rolling again in November 2020</a>, breathing new life into an old idea. WordPress.org would begin displaying theme starter content via the theme preview system. Only the Twenty Twenty-One, Twenty Twenty, and Twenty Seventeen themes received this treatment last year. It now seems that it is being rolled out for others.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is a welcome change in the directory. Users can now <a href=\"https://wp-themes.com/michelle/\">get a feel of the Michelle theme</a> without tracking down the author&rsquo;s demo. It is a better experience than the old-school demo content.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One issue is that the previewer uses the first sentence of the theme description for the demo&rsquo;s tagline. This can make for a long and unusual bit of text. It can also mess up a theme&rsquo;s layout as it is doing with Michelle. I hope this will be addressed from WordPress&rsquo;s end soon.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Other theme authors should note that starter content could factor into whether a user skips over or downloads their theme.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Mon, 05 Apr 2021 23:21:38 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:14:\"Justin Tadlock\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:4;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:20:\"Matt: Doctorow on IP\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:22:\"https://ma.tt/?p=53979\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:37:\"https://ma.tt/2021/04/doctorow-on-ip/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:655:\"<p>It&#8217;s not every day you see noted writer Cory Doctorow refer to a column as &#8220;the piece I&#8217;m most proud of,&#8221; and <a href=\"https://locusmag.com/2020/09/cory-doctorow-ip/\">his essay in Locus Magazine on IP doesn&#8217;t disappoint</a>, connecting the free software movement and the evolution of the term &#8220;author&#8217;s monopolies&#8221; to &#8220;intellectual property.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The essay on DRM and Apple, <a href=\"https://pluralistic.net/2021/03/22/gandersauce/#petard\">available on his WP-powered blog</a>, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/doctorow/status/1374020143316004864\">or Twitter</a>, is also worth reading.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Sun, 04 Apr 2021 02:42:24 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:4:\"Matt\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:5;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:54:\"WordPress.org blog: The Month in WordPress: March 2021\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:35:\"https://wordpress.org/news/?p=10084\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:69:\"https://wordpress.org/news/2021/04/the-month-in-wordpress-march-2021/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:9792:\"<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>This way of iterating improves WordPress and ties back to one of my favorite open-source principles.

The GPL author and founder of the FSF announced last week that he had rejoined the board and is not planning to resign a second time. An <a href=\"https://rms-open-letter.github.io/\">open letter</a> signed by more than 3,000 people called&nbsp;for the removal of Stallman from all leadership positions, including the GNU project, and removal of the entire Board of the FSF. So far it has gained support from Red hat, Mozilla, Outreachy, the Software Conservancy project, and many other high profile organizations.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;We are long past the point where we can pretend that the most important thing about software freedom is the software,&rdquo; Mozilla Engineering Community Manager Michael Hoye said in signing support for the open letter. &ldquo;We cannot demand better from the internet if we do not demand better from our leaders, our colleagues and ourselves.&rdquo; </p>\n\n\n\n<p>In addition to the resignation of former FSF board member Kat Walsh, the organization&rsquo;s executive director, deputy director, and chief technology officer have also resigned. They published a joint <a href=\"https://www.fsf.org/blogs/executive-director/management-team-members-resigning\">statement</a>, reaffirming their commitment to the mission of free software, despite their departure:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p></p><p>As members of FSF management, we have decided to resign, with specific end dates to be determined. We believe in the importance of the FSF&rsquo;s mission and feel a new team will be better placed to implement recent changes in governance. Free software and copyleft are critical issues of our time, and the FSF is, and should continue to be, the organization leading this movement. FSF staff have our utmost respect, support, and appreciation, and it has been a privilege to work with you all. Our team&rsquo;s mutual goal is to ensure a smooth transition while supporting the necessary renovation of the foundation&rsquo;s governance.</p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>An oddly-timed <a href=\"https://twitter.com/fsf/status/1376714994721689601\">tweet</a> announced a new published statement the FSF board voted on, which &ldquo;condemns misogyny, racism, and other bigotry as well as defamation, intimidation, and unfair attacks on free thought and speech.&rdquo; The statement was met with ridicule and outrage on Twitter, as it hints at the defense Stallman used when he <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/gpl-author-richard-stallman-resigns-from-free-software-foundation\">resigned as the FSF board director</a>, claiming he had been subject to &ldquo;a series of misunderstandings and mischaracterizations.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">While our primary mission is freedom for software users, we want to be clear, the FSF board unanimously condemns misogyny, racism,and other bigotry as well as defamation, intimidation, and unfair attacks on free thought and speech.</p>&mdash; Free Software Fndn. (@fsf) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/fsf/status/1376714994721689601?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">March 30, 2021</a></blockquote>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p>Recent statements published to the FSF website indicate that its leadership is doubling down on the decision to reinstate Stallman:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p><a href=\"https://fsf.org/about/staff-and-board\">Some of our colleagues in the FSF</a>&nbsp;have decided to resign. We are grateful for the good work they have done for so long, and we will miss them. We regret losing them; we regret the situation that has motivated them to leave.</p><p>We appreciate their strong commitment to free software and we want to find replacements with a similar competence and commitment. We are open to suggestions and applications for these positions.</p><p>Finally, we would like to thank the numerous friends across the free software movement who have recently joined as well as those who have left and provided suggestions for helping us through this difficult time.</p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>The FSF seems to be counting the resignations as an acceptable loss, as funds from donors are evaporating. Several organizations have discontinued financial support for the organization. Most notably, Red Hat, a long-time donor with hundreds of contributors who have submitted millions of lines of code to projects stewarded by the FSF, publicly <a href=\"https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/red-hat-statement-about-richard-stallmans-return-free-software-foundation-board\">discontinued support</a> for the organization and any of its events. In addition to $708,016 in membership dues, the FSF received $1,383,003 in contributions, gifts, and grants, which makes up the bulk of its annual revenue, according to a recent <a href=\"https://www.charitynavigator.org/index.cfm?bay=search.summary&orgid=8557#accountability-transparency-performance-metrics\">report</a> on Charity Navigator.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Stallman is synonymous with the FSF and his reinstatement puts many free software advocates in a difficult position. Some cannot easily write off the entire organization, as it is engaged in important work. The FSF publishes the GPL, LGPL, and FDL licenses. It also holds copyrights to defend free software from those who would seek to make it proprietary and has the power to enforce the GPL. As part of its <a href=\"https://www.fsf.org/licensing\">Free Software Licensing and Compliance Lab</a>, the organization works to ensure that free software distributors respect their obligations to pass on the user freedoms that these licenses are meant to convey. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Fedora Council cited the FSF&rsquo;s important function when publishing a <a href=\"https://fedoramagazine.org/fedora-council-statement-on-richard-stallman-rejoining-fsf-board/\">statement</a> on why it is pulling funding from the organization:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>Along with many in the free and open source software world, the Fedora Council was taken aback that the Free Software Foundation (FSF) has allowed Richard Stallman to rejoin their Board of Directors given his history of abuse and harassment. The Fedora Council does not normally involve itself with the governance of other projects. However, this is an exceptional case due to the FSF&rsquo;s stewardship of the GPL family of licenses, which are critical for the work we do.</p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>The council will not provide funding or attend any FSF-sponsored events where Stallman is a featured speaker or exhibitor, and stated that this also applies to any organization where he has a leadership role.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>WordPress Responds to Stallman&rsquo;s Reinstatement</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Up until today, WordPress had not published an official statement on Stallman&rsquo;s reinstatement to the FSF board. <a href=\"https://wordpressfoundation.org/\">The WordPress Foundation</a> website lists the Free Software Foundation as one of the project&rsquo;s inspirations. WordPress co-founder Matt Mullenweg was also among the FSF&rsquo;s list of patrons in previous years. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>After asking WordPress&rsquo; executive director Josepha Haden Chomphosy for a comment regarding the matter, she published a <a href=\"https://josepha.blog/2021/04/02/on-recent-news-about-the-fsf-board-of-directors/\">statement</a>: </p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>In short, I do not support his return as a board member.&nbsp;</p><p>It makes me proud that the WordPress project embodies the best traditions of open source and retires outdated traditions, or shibboleths, that do not have a place in our mission: to democratize publishing and grow the open web. For years, this community has been committed to championing underrepresented voices and maintaining a safe and welcoming environment for those we rarely see in open source.&nbsp;</p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Although the statement is published on her personal blog, Haden Chomphosy confirmed that this is the WordPress project&rsquo;s official stance on Stallman&rsquo;s reinstatement. The statement quietly calls out Stallman&rsquo;s lack of accountability and the fact that he has not publicly acknowledged how harmful his behavior has been to the free software community:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>The high standards for welcoming behavior are held across the board. WordPress contributors lead with accountability, acknowledgment of error, and a genuine desire to grow based on feedback. Under the guidance of many thoughtful leaders, WordPress makes space for those who are committed to growth.&nbsp;</p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>The message is more focused on the positive aspects of the WordPress community and its values but is clear in the first paragraph: WordPress does not support Stallman&rsquo;s return as an FSF board member.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Fri, 02 Apr 2021 18:57:11 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:7;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:78:\"WPTavern: Disable the WordPress Block Editor’s Fullscreen Mode With a Plugin\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:30:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=114659\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:195:\"https://wptavern.com/disable-the-wordpress-block-editors-fullscreen-mode-with-a-plugin?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=disable-the-wordpress-block-editors-fullscreen-mode-with-a-plugin\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:3173:\"<p class=\"has-drop-cap\">On Wednesday, Johan Jonk Stenstr&ouml;m released <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/fullscreen-mode-b-gone/\">Fullscreen Mode B Gone</a> to the WordPress plugin directory. As the catchy title implies, it gets rid of the block editor&rsquo;s fullscreen mode.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As anyone who prefers to opt-out of fullscreen mode knows, there are moments when you log into WordPress and hop over to the post editor only to find it is not in the state you last left it. It is a slight annoyance but enough to dampen the user experience.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Nearly two years ago, Andrew Duthie opened a ticket for storing <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/15105\">users&rsquo; editor preferences to the database</a> instead of their browser&rsquo;s local storage. This includes basic settings like toggling whether fullscreen mode should be enabled. Local storage is not considered sticky, at least not permanently. It can be cleared in a variety of ways. This means that users must deal with disabling the default fullscreen editor more often than they should. It is also not stored when switching browsers, using private tabs, or when working on multiple sites across the same network.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The ultimate goal should be to persistently save preferences on a per-user basis. There has been little movement on that ticket in the past year. Most comments have come in the form of closed duplicates.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the meantime, users must look for alternative solutions. That&rsquo;s where plugins like Fullscreen Mode B Gone offer some assistance.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The plugin is simple. It toggles the block editor&rsquo;s fullscreen mode off. Regardless of whether users have switched browsers, cleared their local storage, or anything else, they can safely enter the editor without being bombarded by a different editing experience.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />New post with fullscreen mode disabled.\n\n\n\n<p>Both an upside and a downside of the plugin is that it resets fullscreen mode each time the user opens the editor. It does not address the sticky issue. For users like me who prefer to always have fullscreen mode disabled or only turn it on once in a while, this is ideal. However, for users who want WordPress to remember the last state, it is best to skip this plugin. The default experience is better suited to what you need.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the things I dislike about how the editor works is that it requires JavaScript for plugins to make changes like this. Even if it is merely a few lines of code, it still calls for one more HTTP response just to alter a default setting. At least with PHP, a simple filter would have sufficed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is not Stenstr&ouml;m&rsquo;s first editor-related plugin.

Users can now define a default Image block size. The development team also continued work on normalizing block toolbars, created a &ldquo;theme&rdquo; block category, and added a padding option to the Verse block.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Contributors fixed over 30 bugs. However, the bulk of work went toward Full Site Editing (FSE) with over 70 commits. It is an impressive effort toward the looming WordPress 5.8 deadline and an upcoming decision on whether FSE will land in the release.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The team included a few additional blocks for FSE. The new <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/29766\">Login/out block</a> displays a login or logout link, depending on whether the user is logged out or in, respectively. The block also has an option for displaying a login form. A <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/29428\">Query Title block</a> was included with an Archive Title variation, which will automatically output the current title on archive views. The team also added a <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/29613\">Term Description block</a> for displaying category, tag, and custom taxonomy term descriptions on archives.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Of course, as has become ritual at this point, I am now writing in an editor that looks different than it did a day ago. In version 10.2, all of our Paragraph blocks were shifted to the left.  In 10.3, none of our theme&rsquo;s width constraints are applying to the content canvas.   I still optimistically envision a day in which a Gutenberg update does not affect theme styles.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Default Image Sizes</h2>\n\n\n\n<img />\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-drop-cap\">One of the features I have been patiently awaiting has finally arrived &mdash; <em>sort of.</em> We all have pet-peeves when it comes to the block editor, and not being able to <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/29966\">set the default image size</a> when using the Image block has been high on my list.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A recently-added feature uses the core WordPress <code>image_default_size</code> option to handle this. When set, any new Image blocks added will default to this chosen size. While it is a welcome enhancement, there are two problems with the solution.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The first issue is that this option is not exposed in the WordPress admin interface. That is unless you know how to get to the secret <code>/wp-admin/options.php</code> page. There are no links to it, but users can directly enter the URL, scroll down to find the <code>image_default_size</code> option, and manually type in the size handle (e.g., <code>full</code>, <code>large</code>, etc.) that they want before saving.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The second issue is that it solves the problem on a site-wide level but not on a user level. For publications like WP Tavern with multiple authors, we all have our own preferred workflows. For me, I like to pre-crop all of my images before uploading, which often means that I want to use the full-sized image in the post. However, other writers may want to go a different route. The default image size should be a user preference, falling back to the site setting.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Nevertheless, I am happy to see some progress. I can skip that extra step of setting the image size every time I add an image to a post.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Next, let&rsquo;s make this happen for image alignment. Or, how about we let users set defaults for many more block options to help them streamline their workflows?</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Normalizing Block Toolbar Groupings</h2>\n\n\n\n<img />Semantic groupings for the Paragraph block.\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-drop-cap\">Building off <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/gutenberg-10-1-enhances-reusable-blocks-updates-social-icons-spacing-options-and-normalizes-image-block-toolbar\">work that started in version 10.1</a>, the development team continued <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/25983\">normalizing the block toolbar</a>. Over a dozen blocks received the new treatment.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The end goal is to create semantic groupings of the toolbar buttons for all blocks. This will make it easier for end-users to find options and for developers to know where to place buttons in the future. The order in the toolbar, broken down into four groups, is as follows:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Meta</li><li>Block Level</li><li>Inline Level</li><li>More Options</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>The toolbar separates each grouping with a border. With the Paragraph block, for example, the text alignment option is on the block level. However, the bold, italic, and link settings are inline.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Developers creating custom blocks should follow the best practices under the <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/blob/trunk/docs/how-to-guides/designers/block-design.md\">block design documentation</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Theme Block Category</h2>\n\n\n\n<img />Theme category with Template Part, Header, and Footer blocks.\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-drop-cap\">When using a block-based theme, which enables FSE mode, Gutenberg 10.3 introduces a new <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/30020\">&ldquo;Theme&rdquo; category in the inserter</a>. It currently includes the Template Part, Header, and Footer blocks. The goal for the enhancement is to indicate that they are the building blocks of themes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The enhancement could be better if the category was not so tough to find in the inserter&rsquo;s long list of blocks. I am still arguing that we bring back the original accordion in the UI. In the site editor, it would be better to shift the Theme category to the top, which is primarily for editing theme-related things.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Padding Option for the Verse Block</h2>\n\n\n\n<img />Adding horizontal padding to the Verse block.\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-drop-cap\">Users can now set the <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/29820\">padding for the Verse block</a>. The setting feels a bit out of place right now without any other stylistic options. Background and border options will make padding more relevant in the long term. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>For now, it is nice to see more blocks getting spacing options. It just happened to land on what, I&rsquo;d wager, is the least-used block for WordPress users.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Thu, 01 Apr 2021 22:21:19 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:14:\"Justin Tadlock\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:9;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:99:\"WPTavern: FSE Outreach Round #4: Building a Restaurant-Themed Header With Gutenberg’s Site Editor\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:30:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=114578\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:233:\"https://wptavern.com/fse-outreach-round-4-building-a-restaurant-themed-header-with-gutenbergs-site-editor?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=fse-outreach-round-4-building-a-restaurant-themed-header-with-gutenbergs-site-editor\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:6069:\"<p class=\"has-drop-cap\">Anne McCarthy <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/test/2021/03/25/fse-program-testing-call-4-building-a-restaurant-themed-header/\">announced the fourth round of testing</a> for the Full Site Editing (FSE) Outreach program last week. This testing phase calls for users to build a restaurant-themed header via the Gutenberg plugin&rsquo;s site editor. Testing is open to anyone, and participants should leave feedback by April 8.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The testing process is broken down into 24 steps with both setup and testing instructions. Those participating will need to activate the latest version of the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/themes/tt1-blocks/\">TT1 Blocks</a> theme and the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/gutenberg\">Gutenberg</a> plugin.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The more people who leave feedback, the better it is for the project. The program provides that direct link between the user and the developer team that has often been missing in the past. If you have an hour or so of spare time, jump right in.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Building a Custom Header</h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-drop-cap\">I want to push the site editor beyond its limits, creating move advanced layouts. However, the site builder is so fundamentally limiting &mdash; and broken in some cases &mdash; that it is easy to become frustrated. And, depending on which version of Gutenberg you are using, such as the latest dev vs. stable version, you can get wildly different results.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This propensity to jump ahead of the lesson is something I have done my entire life. In school, I frustrated more than a few teachers. I would be working on stuff from the end of the chapter when they were still explaining the basics to the rest of the class a half-hour later. I have always wanted to get to the &ldquo;good stuff.&rdquo; Of course, I did so by blazing past the boring fundamentals. I also dropped out of software engineering twice in college because building calculators was neither exciting nor challenging.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Like always, I jumped ahead with Round #4 of the FSE Outreach Program. I came to the realization that attempting to do anything remotely advanced with the site editor was simply not going to happen.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I want Full Site Editing to be successful, but we are mere weeks away from the deadline that determines whether it will land in the next version of WordPress. Somehow this experience felt like a step back from where the plugin was a few weeks ago as I built a custom homepage as part of the <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/fse-outreach-round-2-building-a-custom-homepage-with-gutenbergs-site-editor\">second round</a> of the FSE Outreach testing program. I do not know whether the problems stemmed directly from Gutenberg, the TT1 Blocks theme, or both. As someone who prides himself on near-infinite patience, Round #4 sought to crack me.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I wanted to recreate several elements from the UK-based <a href=\"https://www.phocafe.co.uk/\">Pho Cafe</a> page header. I knew the site editor could not yet manage a one-to-one replication.  I still thought I could pull in parts of it but utterly failed.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />Pho Cafe website page header.\n\n\n\n<p>I appreciate the need for controlled circumstances. Step-by-step testing puts everyone on the same page, makes it easier to gather data, and allows others to reproduce issues. I am just bad at it.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Following the Rules</h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-drop-cap\">I restarted from scratch. I followed the rules. And, for the most part, the testing round was successful. I built a restaurant website header from the instructions and put my own spin on it.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />Custom beachside caf&eacute; header design.\n\n\n\n<p>Of course, I hit a few snags. That is what the testing program is all about &mdash; identifying pain points.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The most problematic issue is that what I saw in the editor was not what I got on the front end. I have played around with it enough to know in my mind what it <em>might</em> look like on the front end to make adjustments without previewing the changes. However, that is not the user experience that WordPress is shooting for.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />Editor view of the restaurant website header.\n\n\n\n<p>Admittedly, on the front end, I tidied up the padding for the Group block and bottom margin for the Columns block for the &ldquo;Order Online&rdquo; strip across the top of the header. I thought about making the button smaller too. However, I stuck with the TT1 Blocks theme default. Ultimately, padding, margin, and other types of sizing/spacing should be customizable by the end-user.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Wide and full block alignments completely disappeared after activating TT1 Blocks. I am unsure if this was a recent change in the Gutenberg plugin or the theme. Nevertheless, they were gone, which was one reason I had trouble recreating pieces of the original page header I wanted to build.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The TT1 Blocks theme also has a hardcoded font-size for the site title link. This means that users cannot change the size of the Site Title block. I wanted to bump this up a little to make it more prominent.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Like the first design I was shooting for, I wanted my Navigation items to look like individual buttons, each with a bit of whitespace in between. However, the Navigation block does not currently support adding backgrounds to each nav item. Even if it did, it also does not have a horizontal margin setting to add the spacing. And, I outright refuse to use a <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/gutenberg-10-2-adds-spacers-to-navigation-lists-lets-users-categorize-template-parts-and-introduces-scoped-patterns\">Spacer block between items</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I did want to spruce my restaurant page header up a bit with a custom background. To do that, I added the primary elements inside a Cover block. Currently, the only way to do that is to copy all of the blocks, delete the old ones, and paste them into a new Cover block. A welcome enhancement to the editor would be an option for &ldquo;grouping&rdquo; blocks into a Cover like what is possible with the Group block.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 31 Mar 2021 22:07:52 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:14:\"Justin Tadlock\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:10;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:80:\"WPTavern: First Look at Initial Designs for WordPress’ Block Pattern Directory\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:30:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=114531\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:199:\"https://wptavern.com/first-look-at-initial-designs-for-wordpress-block-pattern-directory?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=first-look-at-initial-designs-for-wordpress-block-pattern-directory\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:3268:\"<p>WordPress contributors began <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-contributors-discuss-launching-an-official-block-pattern-directory\">discussing</a> the possibility of a block pattern directory in October 2020, an idea that garnered enthusiastic support. The directory would offer a place to browse user-submitted patterns, as well as one-click installation of patterns from the block inserter inside the editor. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Interface designer Shaun Andrews <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/design/2021/03/30/wordpress-org-patterns-directory/\">published</a> the initial designs for the pattern directory yesterday. Patterns will be displayed in a masonry-style grid that can be sorted by category, which works well for pattern thumbnails of varying heights. Users can search the directory and sort by featured, newest, and most popular. </p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<a href=\"https://cloudup.com/cK4jSz1Fx9c\"><img src=\"https://cldup.com/HiaWY_zXIf.gif\" alt=\"Masonry grid\" width=\"1024\" height=\"535\" /></a>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p>The idea is that a user will be able to copy a single pattern to their clipboard while visiting the directory and paste it directly into the block editor. Users will also be able to &ldquo;favorite&rdquo; patterns from the directory and access them inside the editor.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<a href=\"https://cloudup.com/czovcau6B_D\"><img src=\"https://cldup.com/OYhRf1SQz9.gif\" alt=\"Copy pattern flow\" width=\"1024\" height=\"757\" /></a>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the most exciting aspects of the plan is that anyone will be able to create and submit a pattern without having a lot of technical knowledge. Andrews shared a quick landing page mockup to explain what patterns are and how to submit one. Prospective pattern authors would be able to create a pattern on WordPress.org using a hosted instance of the block editor with a few tweaks specific to describing and categorizing the pattern.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><img /></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Users who submit patterns will have a new &ldquo;My Patterns&rdquo; screen listing all of their patterns, ones they have favorited, information about how many people have favorited their submitted patterns, and status updates for patterns still in review.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><img /></div>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;This is a big opportunity for designers to contribute to the overall WordPress ecosystem without having to know how to code a&nbsp;plugin&nbsp;or a theme,&rdquo; Andrews said. It opens up a new avenue of design contribution that would not have been possible with the same scale of distribution in the days of the previous editor.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are still many unanswered questions, such as how &ldquo;featured&rdquo; patterns would be chosen, how drafts work, if the patterns can only include core blocks, how users will browse and manage favorite patterns in the editor, who approves the patterns, how pattern authors can edit existing patterns, and more. If you want to help out on the project, check out the Pattern Directory repository on <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/pattern-directory\">GitHub</a>.

The experience was geared toward website designers and developers, providing them with a central location to manage their client projects. More than simply a new set of tools, the company created a dedicated branding experience for GoDaddy Pro.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;We are committed to, passionate about, and truly in awe of web designers and developers,&rdquo; said Adam Warner, the Global Field Marketing Sr. Manager at GoDaddy. &ldquo;It has been a pleasure supporting this audience, but it&rsquo;s now our mission to up the ante and deepen our commitment. Our goal with GoDaddy Pro is to empower web pros with a unified tool that helps them create outsize efficiency for their operation, deliver incredible results for their clients, grow their skills and operation, and connect and inspire by fostering community.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Expand 2021 event is a continuation of that goal. The target audience is described as &ldquo;web designers and developers who identify as eager side hustlers or website freelancers.&rdquo; The conference&rsquo;s sessions are meant to provide instructions, resources, and connections to help developers grow their businesses.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The event will begin with an opening keynote from GoDaddy&rsquo;s Aman Bhutani, the CEO; Tara Wellington, the Senior Director of Product Management; and Warner. It will feature eight sessions, split evenly between each day. The event&rsquo;s schedule will fit into a small window between 10 am and 12:30 pm <a href=\"https://www.timeanddate.com/time/zones/pt\">Pacific Time</a> on both days.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>By some conference standards, even virtual ones, this may seem like a small event. However, the tighter focus could be a welcome one for people suffering from <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/wordcamp-us-2020-canceled-due-to-pandemic-stress-and-online-event-fatigue\">online event fatigue</a>. Each session is scheduled to last around 30 minutes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The sessions will focus on a wide span of topics like client management, eCommerce, creating a project starter stack, website security, and scaling a freelance business with care plans.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>The History Behind GoDaddy Pro Expand</h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-drop-cap\">Spearheading the first Expand conference, Warner avoided talking about target audiences, performance indicators, or budgetary concerns in an internal memo sent throughout GoDaddy. The effort is about creating a series of GoDaddy Pro Expand events globally in the coming months and years that help the community.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The idea for a conference had been in the making since 2018. Warner described the purpose of GoDaddy Pro, Expand 2021, and meetups as empowering and inspiring the next generation of web designers and developers to deliver for their clients and create self-sustaining freelance businesses.</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>Expand 2021 is, in some way, my Opus for giving back to the community that raised me and giving the new generation a head start in following their own passions. It&rsquo;s the culmination of my years exploring and creating on the internet. My first time on the internet was in 1993. I was in my third year of college, working at Hungry Howie&rsquo;s Pizza in small-town Michigan. A co-worker had some of us to her house, and her boyfriend logged us on to a Bulletin Board System (BBS). We chatted in a dull, orange text late into the night to people around the world.</p><p>I was amazed then, and that sense of wonder and possibility stayed with me as I started to learn HTML and build simple websites a few years later. Then came my discovery of WordPress in early 2005 and the incredible global community of users willing to lift each other up for collective success.</p><p>It was at that moment, I knew I had to find a way to make websites and WordPress my career.</p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Now, 28 years later, Warner is taking the next step in organizing his first event from scratch along with over 40 others. He wanted to build a conference that was devoid of &ldquo;talking heads touting theoretical advice.&rdquo; Instead, to offer an experience with actionable knowledge that web professionals can use immediately.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;The real purpose of Expand 2021 is to &lsquo;pay it forward&rsquo; by advising and inspiring the next generation of web designers and developers, enabling them to take the next steps in their paths,&rdquo; said Warner.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Tue, 30 Mar 2021 20:16:19 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:14:\"Justin Tadlock\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:12;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:55:\"WordPress.org blog: So you want to make block patterns?\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:34:\"https://wordpress.org/news/?p=9995\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:70:\"https://wordpress.org/news/2021/03/so-you-want-to-make-block-patterns/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:12967:\"<img width=\"632\" height=\"356\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2021/03/Block-Patterns.jpg?resize=632%2C356&ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-9998\" />\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;ve ever built something for the WordPress block editor — a theme or a plugin — you may have also heard about <strong>block patterns</strong>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Looking at the patterns that come bundled with WordPress, I thought it would be nice to dedicate to them a short post. They&#8217;re pretty nice, useful shortcuts when you know them, but there&#8217;s a good chance you may not know what they are or why you might want to use them.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>What&#8217;s a block pattern?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Patterns are&nbsp;<strong>collections of pre-arranged blocks</strong>&nbsp;that can be combined and arranged in many ways making it easier to create beautiful content. They act as a head-start, leaving you to plug and play with your content as you see fit and be as simple as single blocks or as complex as a full-page layout.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><img width=\"632\" height=\"414\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2021/03/block-library.png?resize=632%2C414&ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-10021\" /></div>\n\n\n\n<p>They live in a tab in the block library. You can click or drag and you&#8217;re able to preview them with your site&#8217;s styles.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><img width=\"632\" height=\"413\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2021/03/block-pattern.png?resize=632%2C413&ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-10022\" /></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Basically, a block pattern is just a bunch of blocks put together in advance:</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>	&lt;!-- wp:group --&gt;\n&lt;div class=\"wp-block-group\"&gt;&lt;div class=\"wp-block-group__inner-container\"&gt;&lt;!-- wp:separator {\"className\":\"is-style-default\"} --&gt;\n&lt;hr class=\"wp-block-separator is-style-default\"/&gt;\n&lt;!-- /wp:separator --&gt;\n&lt;!-- wp:image {\"align\":\"center\",\"id\":553,\"width\":150,\"height\":150,\"sizeSlug\":\"large\",\"linkDestination\":\"none\",\"className\":\"is-style-rounded\"} --&gt;\n&lt;div class=\"wp-block-image is-style-rounded\"&gt;&lt;figure class=\"aligncenter size-large is-resized\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://blockpatterndesigns.mystagingwebsite.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/StockSnap_HQR8BJFZID-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-553\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\"/&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;!-- /wp:image --&gt;\n&lt;!-- wp:quote {\"align\":\"center\",\"className\":\"is-style-large\"} --&gt;\n&lt;blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote has-text-align-center is-style-large\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"Contributing makes me feel like I\'m being useful to the planet.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;cite&gt;— Anna Wong, &lt;em&gt;Volunteer&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n&lt;!-- /wp:quote --&gt;\n&lt;!-- wp:separator {\"className\":\"is-style-default\"} --&gt;\n&lt;hr class=\"wp-block-separator is-style-default\"/&gt;\n&lt;!-- /wp:separator --&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;!-- /wp:group --&gt;</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>That&#8217;s also how you create them: just use the block editor to configure a smattering of blocks to your liking, and the hard part&#8217;s over.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>How do I get them in the block library?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>There&#8217;s <a href=\"https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/developers/block-api/block-patterns/\">more documentation in the handbook</a>, but what it boils down to is this:</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>&lt;?php \n/*\nPlugin Name: Quote Pattern Example Plugin\n*/\n\nregister_block_pattern(\n	\'my-plugin/my-quote-pattern\',\n	array(\n		\'title\'       =&gt; __( \'Quote with Avatar\', \'my-plugin\' ),\n		\'categories\'  =&gt; array( \'text\' ),\n		\'description\' =&gt; _x( \'A big quote with an avatar\".\', \'Block pattern description\', \'my-plugin\' ),\n		\'content\'     =&gt; \'&lt;!-- wp:group --&gt;&lt;div class=\"wp-block-group\"&gt;&lt;div class=\"wp-block-group__inner-container\"&gt;&lt;!-- wp:separator {\"className\":\"is-style-default\"} --&gt;&lt;hr class=\"wp-block-separator is-style-default\"/&gt;&lt;!-- /wp:separator --&gt;&lt;!-- wp:image {\"align\":\"center\",\"id\":553,\"width\":150,\"height\":150,\"sizeSlug\":\"large\",\"linkDestination\":\"none\",\"className\":\"is-style-rounded\"} --&gt;&lt;div class=\"wp-block-image is-style-rounded\"&gt;&lt;figure class=\"aligncenter size-large is-resized\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://blockpatterndesigns.mystagingwebsite.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/StockSnap_HQR8BJFZID-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-553\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\"/&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- /wp:image --&gt;&lt;!-- wp:quote {\"align\":\"center\",\"className\":\"is-style-large\"} --&gt;&lt;blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote has-text-align-center is-style-large\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"Contributing makes me feel like I\\\'m being useful to the planet.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;cite&gt;— Anna Wong, &lt;em&gt;Volunteer&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;!-- /wp:quote --&gt;&lt;!-- wp:separator {\"className\":\"is-style-default\"} --&gt;&lt;hr class=\"wp-block-separator is-style-default\"/&gt;&lt;!-- /wp:separator --&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- /wp:group --&gt;\',\n	)\n);\n\n?&gt;</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p><img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/1f446.png\" alt=\"👆\" class=\"wp-smiley\" /> That&#8217;s a snippet of PHP, which means you can drop it in a WordPress plugin, or perhaps more simply, paste it into the <strong>functions.php</strong> file from your theme. Done:</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><img width=\"632\" height=\"430\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2021/03/Quote.jpg?resize=632%2C430&ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-10047\" /></div>\n\n\n\n<p>For patterns that include images, it&#8217;s worth thinking about where those are stored. The <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/themes/tt1-blocks/\">TT1 Blocks theme</a> (which is a fancy name for &#8220;TwentyTwentyOne Blocks&#8221;) stores images in the theme library.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Now what?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The thing about a block pattern is, as soon as you insert it from the block library, it stops being <em>a cohesive unit</em> — now it&#8217;s just a smattering of blocks, detached from the pattern you created and meant to be customized to your liking. It&#8217;s a <em>shortcut</em>, not a <em>template</em>. That also means you don&#8217;t have to worry about switching themes or deactivating pattern plugins: the blocks you already inserted won&#8217;t go anywhere.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That being said, if you like this one pattern so much you want to use it again and again, with no customization at all, you can make it into a <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/news/2021/02/gutenberg-tutorial-reusable-blocks/\">reusable block</a>:</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Reusable blocks are created, as the name implies, to be reused. The feature is a great way to store small bits of commonly used snippets that you can edit in one place to update in all. &#8220;<strong>Follow me on Twitter</strong>,&#8221; &#8220;<strong>Article series</strong>,<strong>&#8220;</strong> or <strong>&#8220;Subscribe to my podcast&#8221;</strong> are great examples of that.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>What makes a good block pattern?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Patterns, as they ship today, are limited by the features available. If the block editor doesn&#8217;t allow you to customize letter-spacing, your block pattern can&#8217;t either. While the Global Styles project will expand what&#8217;s to blocks, in the meantime, we have to work with the available tools.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Even then, with the most basic ingredients — color, photography, typography — it is possible to do a lot:</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/W3RKCu5c7ONKnmuLdChmOhD40iZAFseq30i-qGwqFaq0dPTj_U5b1JXhhRR96-jRvJvKgC8BBZA4p_-EBYF-WoMRPoDLgCX8FG3RIWQhv6zX6-H7xBj4FZGGRm7cl_qdVgRy9G8q\" alt=\"\" />Three columns with images and text<br /></div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><img width=\"632\" height=\"397\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2021/03/Media-and-text-with-image-on-the-right-1.png?resize=632%2C397&ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-10036\" />Media and text with image on the right</div>\n\n\n\n<p>I designed these patterns to potentially land in WordPress core, which all have a few properties in common:</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>They share a theme.</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>You can think of a pattern as a section of a website: it is meant to be part of a whole, and so it works best when it can exist in the context of other patterns that share the same theme. There are a few sharing a Nature theme in the patterns above, a few sharing an Art theme, and others sharing an Architecture theme. When seen together, it becomes easier to see how you might be able to piece together multiple pages of your site, one page at a time.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"blocks-gallery-grid\"><li class=\"blocks-gallery-item\"><img width=\"632\" height=\"406\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2021/03/Large-header-with-text-and-a-button.png?resize=632%2C406&ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-10033\" /></li><li class=\"blocks-gallery-item\"><img width=\"632\" height=\"405\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2021/03/Media-text-with-image-on-the-right.png?resize=632%2C405&ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-10034\" /></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>They share a minimalist color palette.</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>By being parts of a whole, patterns will inevitably land in a context that uses different colors. With a reduced color palette, there&#8217;s both a better chance of fitting in and less to customize to make it just right.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"blocks-gallery-grid\"><li class=\"blocks-gallery-item\"><img width=\"632\" height=\"535\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2021/03/Heading-and-a-paragraph.jpg?resize=632%2C535&ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-10042\" /></li><li class=\"blocks-gallery-item\"><img width=\"632\" height=\"271\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2021/03/Media-text-in-a-full-height-container.jpg?resize=632%2C271&ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-10043\" /></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>The best patterns <strong>do things you might have not done otherwise</strong>.</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Whether that&#8217;s images offset to create a unique silhouette, or just using less visible features (like fixed positioning in the Cover block), it&#8217;s a way to surface creativity.</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p><em>Tip: You can use any block in your patterns, including blocks that came from a plugin.

Any open source project can receive contributions from a Fund, even those that are not listed on Open Collective due to having their own foundation or working with another fiscal host. The new feature was added to Open Collective&rsquo;s existing non-profit funding platform that serves more than 2,500 projects. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Funds were designed to mitigate the friction between corporations and open source projects, cutting out the excessive bureaucracy that can sometimes stifle funding for smaller projects. Companies can use the feature to support multiple projects that are crucial to their business efforts and underlying tech.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;Funds facilitates a relationship between maintainers and organizations on their own terms,&rdquo; Open Collective co-founder Pia Mancini said. &ldquo;No contracts, no promises, no agendas. We take on the work of administrating payments to projects and of ensuring companies have what they need in their procurement processes.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Traditionally, if you wanted to work on an open source project full time, you would most likely need to be sponsored by a company. Although WordPress&rsquo; &ldquo;<a href=\"https://wordpress.org/five-for-the-future/\">Five for the Future</a>&rdquo; campaign isn&rsquo;t perfect, it has brought some stability, enabling the project to drive important efforts forward even in leaner times of contribution from unpaid volunteers. Some open source projects aren&rsquo;t able to thrive this way, especially those that are categorized as simple utilities.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Critical dependencies can sometimes be grossly underfunded when supported by only a handful of individuals who may not have steady employment to buoy their maintainership efforts. The <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"http://heartbleed.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Heartbleed Bug</a> that was disclosed in 2014 put a spotlight on the immense economic challenges of funding open source work. In the aftermath of this global fiasco, the tech industry turned its attention towards brainstorming different initiatives that might create a more healthy ecosystem.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Open Collective&rsquo;s Funds feature aims to make &ldquo;working for an open source project a legitimate alternative to a career working for a for-profit corporation.&rdquo; Prior to launching the new feature, the platform quietly tested a number of Funds with Airbnb, Indeed, Salesforce, and other companies with successful outcomes for maintainers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;Airbnb&rsquo;s investment in webpack has enabled groundbreaking advancements in web compiler technology, paved the way for the last 2 major versions, and enabled us to devote entire teams to ecosystem management, CLI, docs, and infrastructure,&rdquo; webpack core team member Sean Larkin said. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Airbnb received so many reports of the positive impact of its Fund that the company decided to expand its open source sustainability commitment by 50% to $150,000.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;Donations from Airbnb have made it possible for ESLint to pay core contributors for work,&rdquo; ESLint creator Nicholas Zakas said. &ldquo;As a result, contributors are able to spend more time pushing forward large projects that weren&rsquo;t possible when we relied solely on volunteering.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As open source projects are becoming less self-contained and more interdependent, maintaining the health of the overall ecosystem is a priority. When smaller utilities that everyone depends on are underfunded, it can have a ripple effect that slows down progress throughout the vast web of projects that rely on the dependency. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Open Collective&rsquo;s Funds feature is one solution that helps companies streamline their donations and keep track of their contributions to multiple projects in one place. Companies interested in creating a new Fund can get in touch with the organization via its <a href=\"https://www.oscollective.org/contact\">contact form</a>.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Tue, 30 Mar 2021 06:39:15 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:14;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:76:\"WPTavern: Creating Tiled, Masonry, and Other Image Layouts With Meow Gallery\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:30:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=114473\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:193:\"https://wptavern.com/creating-tiled-masonry-and-other-image-layouts-with-meow-gallery?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=creating-tiled-masonry-and-other-image-layouts-with-meow-gallery\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:4546:\"<p class=\"has-drop-cap\">I am uncertain of how I first came across the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/meow-gallery/\">Meow Gallery</a> WordPress plugin. It was a pinned tab in my browser for a while, but it has recently become one of those projects that I keep coming back to. I delight in the imagery of the Meow Apps brand, created by Japan-based software developer Jordy Meow. It has the sort of fun and artistic visuals that are often missing in the WordPress business ecosystem. This creativity also comes across in the Meow Apps plugins.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The problem with WordPress gallery plugins is that I find a new one I want to use every other week. It is a bit of an obsession. There are so many different options that it is tough to grow comfortable with a solution before finding something new and shiny to tinker with.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Such is the case with Meow Gallery. From the simplicity of its options to the range of layouts that the plugin provides, it has found its way onto my ever-growing list of favorite gallery-related plugins.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I also prefer the decoupled, modular nature of what Meow Apps is doing with its plugins. Meow Gallery keeps a tight focus on the gallery layout itself.  Users can select an image lightbox/overlay extension separately. <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/meow-lightbox/\">Meow Lightbox</a> is recommended, of course. However, both are developed to work alongside third-party gallery or lightbox plugins. It is the sort of building-block solution that more developers in the community should embrace, ultimately offering end-users more freedom.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Meow Gallery is straightforward to use. It works similarly to the core Gallery block. When first adding images, users can drag-and-drop them directly into it or select from their media library. From that point, the experiences begin to diverge.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />Tiled gallery with 10px gutter.\n\n\n\n<p>Instead of selecting the number of columns, whether to crop, or the image size, the Meow Gallery block automatically handles this based on the type of layout chosen.  Options may change based on the layout too. The following are available:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Tiles</li><li>Masonry</li><li>Justified</li><li>Square</li><li>Cascade</li><li>Carousel (pro only)</li><li>Map (pro only)</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>The block also offers a handful of basic animations, link options, and more. However, the gutter setting provides more control over the output. The gutter is the horizontal and vertical space between images. Users can choose between 0 and 100. Gutter spacing is the one option from the plugin that WordPress should adopt, allowing theme authors to opt-into a default and users to customize.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />Square-layout gallery with no gutter.\n\n\n\n<p>The plugin also has <a href=\"https://meowapps.com/plugin/meow-gallery/\">commercial features</a>, but they are value-added upsells instead of necessary functionality. The pro version includes extras like more layouts, new animations, and infinite scrolling for galleries with many images.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The one off-putting issue with Meow Gallery is that it creates a custom block. Having already seen solutions from other plugin authors that extend the default Gallery block, I was hoping this plugin would go in the same direction. Extending the core block makes it easier for end-users to switch gallery plugins at any point. However, users can transform Meow Gallery blocks into Gallery blocks and vice versa.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Keep in mind that the WordPress Gallery block is also undergoing drastic changes. Currently, the plan is to make it more of a container block that houses nested Image blocks. By not extending the core block, plugin users will miss out on some of the advantages this change brings. Of course, the plugin developer could follow suit and add the same features to the project.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Meow Gallery relies on the WordPress <code>gallery</code> shortcode. Therefore, it will continue working regardless of whether users deactivate the plugin in the future. As a fallback, it is not a perfect solution. Users of the block editor would likely rather have it revert to the core Gallery block &mdash; the shortcode and block are not remotely the same. However, it is a bit of a compromise between showing a working gallery or nothing at all.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I suspect the reliance on the shortcode is for historical reasons. Meow Gallery existed in the pre-block era. However, the developer has managed to keep up with the times, offering support for both the block and classic editor.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Mon, 29 Mar 2021 21:26:37 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:14:\"Justin Tadlock\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:15;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:55:\"WordPress.org blog: WP Briefing: How WordPress Improves\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:52:\"https://wordpress.org/news/?post_type=podcast&p=9980\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:58:\"https://wordpress.org/news/2021/03/how-wordpress-improves/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:10231:\"<p>In this episode, <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/chanthaboune/\">Josepha Haden Chomphosy</a> explores the WordPress release process.

I&#8217;m your host, Josepha Haden Chomphosy. Here we go!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>All right, so last week, we wrapped up and shipped the WordPress 5.7 release. The release team this time around was smaller than we&#8217;ve had in the last couple of years. By the numbers, it looks really good: 66 enhancements or feature requests went in, 127 bugs were fixed, and seven versions of a Gutenberg plugin were merged and backported. If you use WordPress, you are probably aware that we have new releases throughout the year, but you probably don&#8217;t know much about the release process. There&#8217;s not really a reason to know unless you&#8217;re actively contributing to a release. For those interested in knowing more about how we improve WordPress, this week&#8217;s exploration is for you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We&#8217;re gonna take a look at what goes into WordPress releases and just kind of zoom our way in from the highest level. At the highest level, there are three major WordPress releases a year, plus the minor releases, plus Gutenberg releases. So if you&#8217;re following current WordPress work and future WordPress work, that&#8217;s going to get you to probably around <strong>30 releases a year</strong>. If we zoom in one level to the release itself, a single release of WordPress takes four to five months from start to the day that we ship, and an additional four to six weeks on support and translations, and minor releases after that. If you&#8217;re looking from my vantage point, you&#8217;ll see that WordPress releases have essentially five parts, some of which happen kind of simultaneously.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The first part is planning and includes the project lead, lead developers, design; groups like that. The second phase is the creation phase when we&#8217;re actually building the things that have to go into the CMS that involves the design, core, editor, mobile, and other teams. Then there&#8217;s this phase that I like to refer to as the distribution phase. This is mostly done by the teams that make sure that WordPress is widely distributable; the polyglots team work on translations, accessibility does some work, docs make sure that everything is documented, and training, of course, gets things ready for when we have to be able to tell people how to use the release.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Then there is the fourth phase; I really don&#8217;t think they go sequentially or in a waterfall format. The fourth-ish phase that I include, and that I tend to see, is this extending and iteration phase. It&#8217;s the phase where we see our theme authors and our plugin authors, folks who are doing support, show up and help us to make sure that WordPress is available not only widely but broadly to ensure that their audiences as theme authors and plugin authors are covered in the features that they need based on what they are using WordPress for. The fifth phase is the part of our communication that involves the community team, especially marketing, WordPressTV, and learn.wordpress.org. Basically, anyone who&#8217;s showing up to make sure that we all share what happened in the release, the features that are coming, and how that affects the users is involved in that particular phase. So five big phases of what happens over those four to five months, and then for the month or month and a half afterward.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If we zoom in a bit more on the creation phase, each release has people who lead the work and coordinate contributor efforts during the course of the release. For any given release, hundreds of people contribute and receive credit for moving the WordPress project forward. Okay, hold on a second. Let&#8217;s pump the brakes and zoom in a bit on that. Hundreds of people work on every major release for a project that powers over 40% of the web that feels like a small number. But for the people who process the contributions in preparation for release, it&#8217;s actually pretty substantial. For every release, there is a small team of leaders who asked the hard questions. Is this a usable feature? Does this make WordPress better overall? And, of course, is this ready to ship?&nbsp; Some of those leaders, a smaller subset of even the leaders that we have already, are committers who actually prep and merge patches to the CMS; they don&#8217;t do all the work to create a design or write all the code. This tiny group of people processes hundreds and hundreds of bug fixes, improvements, and enhancements that have been submitted over the course of months and sometimes years. As a side note, that whole process is a little smaller, a little faster in the Gutenberg featured plugin, but the basic parts are still there. Alright, so we&#8217;ve zoomed from the big picture way into some of the finer details, and it really looks like any other project cycle. So now, I&#8217;m going to layer in the filter of open source to that process.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are a couple of things that make building software in an open source environment so different. The first is that the code is readily available. If you have a basic understanding of the languages, you can see the code, learn from it, and make suggestions about improving it. Second, you consider the user a co-developer in the process, which means that as long as people use your product, they will have opinions on what you shipped. This way of iterating improves WordPress and ties back to one of my favorite open source principles. The idea that with many eyes, all bugs are shallow. To me, that means that with enough people looking at a problem, someone is bound to be able to see the solution.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This brings us to our community highlight, the segment where I share a note about contributors who have helped others along the way or a WordPress success story. This week&#8217;s highlight is from Nok in our Bangkok community. When asked to help her find her way into the WordPress community, she said, “@shinichiN who started the WordPress community in Bangkok and encouraged me to contribute, and also @mayukojpn has introduced me to the WP community team to join as a deputy. “ Thank you for sharing those two inspiring people with us. And if you, listener, have any stories that you would like to share of your own WordPress success or people that you have been so grateful to help you find your way in the project, you can feel free to email those to me at <a href=\"mailto:wpbriefing@wordpress.org\">wpbriefing@wordpress.org</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That brings us to our final segment of the WP Briefing, the small list of big things. I only have three things to share with you this week. The first one is that about a week ago, we had our first release of 2021. It was the WordPress 5.7 release, titled Esperanza. If you have not yet seen it, go ahead and update your website or check with your host and make sure that they have updated you if you&#8217;re on a managed host. And then take a listen to the artists that it&#8217;s named after.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The second thing that I want you to keep an eye out for is wordpress.org/news. We are starting a new series of content that gets at the heart of some of Gutenberg’s basic parts; there’s a lot of change coming up in the next few releases of WordPress. And the most important thing to me is that you understand what we&#8217;re trying to change and where those changes are primarily taking place. There will be a couple of tutorials that go up there over the course of the of the next few weeks. The third item on the small list of big things is to remind you of our call for testing. As I mentioned earlier in the podcast, the users of any open source software are the code developers; the software built is supposed to make your life and work easier. When you test things and find interactions that can use a little bit of refinement or features that are not working exactly as expected, it&#8217;s incredibly helpful for us to have that information to always make sure that we&#8217;re solving problems instead of accidentally creating them. If you want to participate in the Current call for testing, you can head over to make.wordpress.org/test. Or, if you&#8217;ve been doing your own testing, you can also submit any bugs you have found in the GitHub repo, which I will share in the show notes below. So that, my friends, is your small list of big things. Thank you for tuning in today for the WordPress briefing. I’m your host, Josepha Haden Chomphosy. I&#8217;ll see you again in a couple of weeks!</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Mon, 29 Mar 2021 15:15:03 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:7:\"Josepha\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:16;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:83:\"WordPress.org blog: WP Briefing: My Typical Day as WordPress’s Executive Director\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:52:\"https://wordpress.org/news/?post_type=podcast&p=9825\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:83:\"https://wordpress.org/news/2021/03/my-typical-day-as-wordpresss-executive-director/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:9925:\"<p>In this episode, Josepha Haden Chomphosy speaks to her role as the Executive Director of WordPress.

I&#8217;m your host, Josepha Haden Chomphosy. Here we go!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;ve been asked many times what the day-to-day work looks like for the Executive Director of the WordPress project. I don&#8217;t really think I&#8217;ve done a great job of answering that question. My default answer is either too broad, and I say, “I helped turn the WordPress vision into reality by supporting the community of contributors,” or way too narrow, and I start telling people what&#8217;s on my calendar. Probably no one cares about each entry on my calendar, and almost every contributor is covered by “I get things done by helping people.” So today, I invite you to join me in exploring the type of work required and the balance it takes to keep WordPress working.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>First, some context on the weekly activity I see in WordPress, on average, 1,800 to 2,000 contributors a week, participate in conversations and tickets across the entire WordPress project in our entire ecosystem. There are about 20 volunteer teams that are each led by two to three team reps. Each of those teams actually has smaller groups that work on specific things; all told, it&#8217;s probably about 50 distinct teams. And probably quite a few more if you are very generous in your counting about what makes up a team for us.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Among those teams, a minimum of about 35 meetings a week are held, plus more for working groups. That doesn&#8217;t take into account the things most people are aware of externally.&nbsp; It doesn&#8217;t take into account the big quarterly or annual activity things like WordPress software releases or any of our events. When those sorts of things do happen, there&#8217;s a bit of an increase in our activity.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&nbsp;I work 40 to 60 hours a week on WordPress, depending on what&#8217;s going on, to make sure that I know what&#8217;s happening now; so that I have insight into what the next three to five years will bring. All of that is in support of <strong>the WordPress community, which I define as anyone who has ever interacted with WordPress ever</strong>, regardless of whether they know it or not. In case you&#8217;re feeling a bit lost right now, we can shorthand that entire context as this is really big and really complex.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Given that giant scope, it makes sense that people wonder what the work looks like. So I&#8217;ll talk about it in three big chunks: what I focus my time on, what I focus my attention on, and what helps me balance my decisions.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So first, what I focus my time on. I spend about a quarter of my time in meetings, mostly with current contributors, project leadership, and community members. I spend another quarter of my time in WordPress community outreach, checking in with current folks, reaching out to future WordPressers, and checking in with people that I haven&#8217;t heard from in a long time to make sure that I know what they need and if there&#8217;s anything that I can do to help. After that, I spend a bit under 15% of my time each on writing/communications work or ad hoc project work. I then spend 10% of my time reviewing proposals, editing, communication drafts for others, and determining my stances on discussions that we&#8217;re having in tickets and elsewhere. I spend all of my remaining time planning for various goals, projects, initiatives and personally working to remove blockers for our volunteer contributors. So the bulk of my time, about 50% or more, is spent in calls with people, which makes sense if you&#8217;ve ever worked with me; personal connections with the community have been the best part of my job for a long time. Since the community is what makes WordPress so great, it&#8217;s only natural that I want to stay connected.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The second big chunk is what I focus my attention on. I pay attention to four big pillars of work in the project. The first one is the WordPress CMS itself. So that&#8217;s the core team, accessibility, design, and many, many others. The second one is the WordPress community. And that&#8217;s the training team, everybody who is working on the Learn initiative, and the actual community team as well.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The third big pillar that I focus on is the WordPress contributor experience, which is mostly the meta team but&nbsp; includes all of the teams they work with: plugins, themes, polyglots, etc. The fourth big pillar that I turn my attention to is our communication; what I am saying about the WordPress project to people outside of it and what I am helping our team reps to say about the work that we&#8217;re accomplishing for the WordPress project inside the project. In general, we have to make sure that we coordinate a big group of contributors around a common idea or a common practice as we move forward.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now, the way I focus both my time and attention probably isn&#8217;t quite right if you&#8217;re focused on a single feature or team. And it&#8217;s definitely not right if you aren&#8217;t spending 40 hours a week in the project; what that probably looks like for you is more like an hour in a team meeting, 30 minutes or so on clarifying conversations, and any remaining time that you are able to contribute focused on the feature that you&#8217;re actually contributing to. And so, there you have it all my time and attention. That is WordPress in a nutshell.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This brings us to the third chunk, the balance part. You might be wondering, how do I make sure I am fair and balanced in decisions that I have to make. That is something that I think about all the time, and I take very seriously. It&#8217;s hard to make decisions that might affect 2,000 people. It&#8217;s even harder when those decisions might affect 40% of the web. I know that I don&#8217;t have all the answers. And I&#8217;m fortunate enough to have 50 or 60 people in the community who offer me advice and guidance every single week. I&#8217;m in constant contact with the project lead, of course, but I also prioritize messages and concerns raised from team reps. And I always strive to understand before I try to problem solve. I don&#8217;t always get it right, but I do always work to get better. And that is the day-to-day work of a WordPress executive director.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That brings us to our community highlight. I tweeted out into the community asking for excellent examples of Freelancer success stories, and today I&#8217;m going to share a story from <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/ideag/\">Arūnas Liuiza</a>. Their story goes like this:&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">“For almost a decade, freelance WordPress gigs allowed me to support myself and my family and keep my full-time teaching position at the local college, which was paying peanuts but was an awesome, meaningful, and fulfilling. I am sincerely grateful for that.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That brings us to our final segment of this brief podcast. The small list of big things to keep an eye out for in the next two weeks in WordPress. I only have two things this week. The first one is daylight saving time. It is that time of year where daylight saving time starts or stops at various parts in the globe. If you are a team rep here at WordPress, don&#8217;t forget to talk to your teams in your meetings in the next few weeks to decide what you&#8217;re going to do. You can move your team meeting if you want, and you can keep it where it is and see what new voices show up when it moves around for various people. Either way, make sure that you chat it out with your team and make sure that everybody understands what is and isn&#8217;t moving on your calendar. That will also be relevant to any of our brand new work-from-home folks in the middle of this global pandemic.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The second thing to share is that there is a major release of WordPress coming up that&#8217;s going to happen on March 9th. It’s WordPress 5.7; it&#8217;s going to be a good release. We&#8217;ve been working on it since December or maybe a little bit earlier. So keep an eye out for announcements about that here on wordpress.org/news, or if you want to follow more about the developer details and the process details you can head on over to wordpress.org/core. That, my friends, is your small list of big things. Thank you for tuning in today for the WordPress briefing. I’m your host, Josepha Haden Chomphosy.

I&#8217;m your host, Josepha Haden Chomphosy. Here we go!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Josepha [0:41]: This month, we have a bonus briefing, so I&#8217;ve asked my dear friend and colleague <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/matveb/\">Matías Ventura</a> to join me. Matías was recently called “the spark behind the vision of Gutenberg.” With full site editing coming our way in 202, I asked if he would join me for a quick Q&amp;A. Welcome, Matías.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Matías [0:56]: Hello, hello! Thanks for inviting me. It&#8217;s a pleasure to be here.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Josepha [1:00]: Well, I&#8217;m delighted to have you. And I think that we have a lot of excellent questions. All right, so Matías, we actually ended up with questions in about three different groupings. And so I&#8217;m going to start with the “what is it about full site editing,” sorts of questions that people had. We&#8217;re gonna work our way into “what are we doing with it?” and then “how are we planning on getting this out the door?” Then, a couple of big picture questions that people asked. We&#8217;re just gonna leap right in this full site editing part of the Gutenberg plugin, or is it a standalone plugin?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Matías [1:39]: Okay, we&#8217;ll start with the basics. Full site editing is part of the Gutenberg plugin right now. I think it&#8217;s important to mention that full site editing is like an umbrella for several projects that we&#8217;re working on. They are all aiming to bring blocks into more parts of your site so that editing becomes easier and more expressive, and so on. So full site editing right now encompasses adding a ton of new blocks. I think we have around 20 new blocks coming in, including navigation query, site, title, logo, etc. There&#8217;s also the interface to interact with templates outside of the content; that&#8217;s another big part of the full site editing project. We also have a lot of new design tools included, many of these have been released in previous major releases, but they still comprise a strong part of what full site editing is. We also have something called Global Styles, which aims to allow people to configure the visual aspects of blogs across the entire site, not just on any individual blog. And of course, then there&#8217;s a whole layer of how we utilize these tools. It can get complex because there are many layers and projects that need to come together. So yeah, all of these are accessible through the Gutenberg plugin right now.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Josepha [3:07]: Yeah. So it&#8217;s not a standalone plugin. If you wanted to check out full site editing the site editor experience as it is now, you would just have to make sure you had the Gutenberg plugin on your site. Right?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Matías: Yes, correct.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Josepha:&nbsp; So a couple of the questions related to this are how exactly do I enable it on my site? And what is the easiest and safest way to try this on my site? And I think the answer is, is right in there. It&#8217;s in the Gutenberg plugin. And so if you have that plugin, you don&#8217;t need the testing plugin or anything else to make that work, right?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Matías [3:51]:&nbsp; No, you like, you might need to install a theme like Twenty Twenty One blocks that unlock some of these new interfaces that we just talked about. Like other of these pieces are available for anything. But some of these, like the interface to edit templates, right now only talk with things that know how to express their desire.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Josepha [4:14]: And I think we have less than 10 themes right now that do that, but I&#8217;ll leave some links to at least 2021 blocks in the show notes. And then, if there are another one or two themes that I can find, I can add those in there as well.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So you have to have the Gutenberg plugin; you have to have a theme that works with that site editor kind of experience. And then you&#8217;re safe to try everything out. It shows up in your left toolbar just like any other thing, like if you were working with plugins, or if you were adding a post or anything else, right?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Matías [4:51]: Yes, correct. And so, some of these details are being worked on right now. Like how and where you access things, and so on. These things are subject to change, but right now, you have this site editor beta in the sidebar when both you have the plugin running and a theme that&#8217;s capable.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Josepha [5:10]: Yeah. Excellent note. If you are running this on a production website, I would recommend you not do that unless you are very, very good with WordPress. It&#8217;s a really safe and easy thing to test and try out. But because it is still in beta, I recommend always putting it on a test site. I have a couple of different test sites that I run on myself. Another question that I had was, “will full site editing slow down my site?” And I think we have some refreshed performance tests coming out about that. And maybe they&#8217;ll be out by the time we publish this podcast.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Matías [5:49]: Yeah, I mean, like the performance has been one of the major focuses for the whole project. In many cases, it should speed up things because we&#8217;re like, I think one of the big pieces that these projects bring into the picture, especially for themes, is that it allows only the necessary assets to be loaded on the front end. For example, if for a given page, there are, I don&#8217;t know, 10-15 blocks being used, you would only get the CSS and scrapes and so on related to those blocks. This can cut down on a lot a ton of CSS that themes used to end queue on a side, particularly if you were trying to customize many widgets and so on, like a lot of themes have the full styles or multiple widgets, even third party plugins, and so on. So one of the advantages of having this blog system is that we can know at the time of rendering what blogs are being used and only load those assets.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Josepha [6:50]: Excellent. Another big question that we have is, “does full site editing work with the classic editor? And does it work with other builders?” I think that&#8217;s a really big answer if you&#8217;re going to get super deep into it. But I think that the short answer is yes, it does. Is that fair?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Matías [7:08]: Yeah, I don&#8217;t think it touches a bit on that full site editing is not like a single thing. There are multiple projects around it. So again, like the template editor that only deals with blogs, it doesn&#8217;t have a lot to do with a classic editor. But the classic editor use for both doesn&#8217;t change anything at all; like the same way that when the block editor was introduced, it didn&#8217;t change how you could still write posts in the classic editor. You will still be able to do that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Josepha [7:41]: And if you are brand new to WordPress person, or, I mean, I guess at this point, you don&#8217;t have to be super brand new. If you&#8217;re fairly new to WordPress person and have no idea what we&#8217;re talking about when we say the classic editor, you don&#8217;t really have to worry about it either. You don&#8217;t have to go and find out what that is; the block editor that you have right now works perfectly for what you&#8217;re trying to do. So if you don&#8217;t know what I mean when I say classic editor, don&#8217;t worry about chasing it down either.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think that this last question we accidentally answered earlier, but I&#8217;m going to go ahead and ask it anyway since I received it. “I keep hearing that you can use the site editor with the 2021 theme. But I don&#8217;t seem to be able to. What am I missing?” I think the answer is that there&#8217;s the Twenty Twenty One theme shipped with the WordPress release 5.6. And then there is the Twenty Twenty One blocks theme; those are two different themes. The link to the Twenty Twenty One block theme is going to be in our show notes this time around. And so, if you have been trying to use the full site editor with Twenty Twenty One and not succeeding, try the link to the one below. And I bet that that will work for you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Matías [8:50]: Yes, that&#8217;s correct.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Josepha [8:51]: All right, excellent. Well, that brings us kind of into our second set of questions, which is about how we are doing it. The first one that folks have is “will full site editing be on by default in the next release. In this context, the next release is WordPress 5.8. But I think it&#8217;s a safe question to ask if full site editing will be on by default in the release that it&#8217;s planned for.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Matías [9:15]: Yeah, and for this, I need to go back to the same principle of many projects because there are many pieces of full site editing, and we have been merging them in major releases, particularly like the blocks and the design tools. There are more coming in that we want to make accessible as soon as possible. The full experience that requires a theme to opt-in to templates using blogs won’t be by default; it requires a specific theme running. A lot of these details we&#8217;re still like determining exactly what projects are ready to be merged and so on. But yeah, if you have a theme right now that works the way you want, it doesn&#8217;t change anything there. If anything, it adds some more capabilities and more customization tools, and so on. And the theme can also regulate how much they want to incorporate.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Josepha [10:13]: Matías, you&#8217;ve mentioned a couple of times in this podcast so far like this is a really complex and really complicated part of this work. And just for anyone out there who&#8217;s either encountering Gutenberg or full site editing or this podcast for the first time, I think a tiny bit of context that&#8217;s worth having here is that Matías and I have been working on this together in various capacities for like, five years. And Matías has probably been working on this for practically a decade. So, when we say that this is a really complicated problem, and when we say that this is a complex set of issues that we&#8217;re working with like, it is all that we have been thinking about for I want to say at least the last three or four years, but certainly it&#8217;s all that we have been trying to untangle for quite a bit of time before that as well. So we don&#8217;t take it lightly when we&#8217;re like, “this is complicated;” we mean it. It&#8217;s really complicated. And we&#8217;re trying our hardest over here as WordPress.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The next big question, since we&#8217;re all stuck in the “it&#8217;s very complicated,” part of things is the question, “will this update break my current site?” Like, if I have a site that is updated and ready, and it&#8217;s exactly as I wanted it to be, and it took me two years to get there will full site editing, whichever release it&#8217;s in. Currently, 5.8 is what we&#8217;re planning for. Will that break anything on my site as I know it right now?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Matías [11:44]: No, not at all. One of the major things that the WordPress team, the WordPress community, always cares so much about, never to break things. Many of these things are stepping stones that you can adopt, as we&#8217;ve talked about full site editing. But for example, we also have a few concurrent projects around the widget screen and the navigation screen that are meant to bring blocks into existing interfaces. So again, the theme doesn&#8217;t need to change, and a lot of care is being put into making this more like you&#8217;re unlocking new features, and nothing really breaks or falls apart.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Josepha [12:23]: This update, like all the other updates, should have minimal, minimal impact on what you have to actively fix on your site. Every once in a while, a bug is gonna get by. We can&#8217;t say that we&#8217;re 100% perfect with not breaking things. But also, we always and I and I know that we&#8217;re planning on this for our remaining releases for the rest of the year. At the very least, I can&#8217;t imagine we&#8217;d ever change it. But after every major release, we always make a plan to have a minor release within the next one or two weeks. Because we know that a broken thing on a site is really incredibly impactful, even if you&#8217;re only 1% of the sites that had that happen to it. And so I think that&#8217;s true in this case, too. And getting that feedback back from all of the people who are actually using WordPress is the thing that makes us be able to kind of move quickly when we do see those problems.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the questions that we have been getting is, “can I see a live preview without saving the changes that I made?” When I got this question, I didn&#8217;t actually understand it. And so I went and looked at a site without the Gutenberg plugin on it, and then a site with the Gutenberg plugin on it. And of course, on sites without Gutenberg, without the block editor, without full site editing, when you are looking to preview, you have the option to open up your preview in a new window. And you don&#8217;t have that with Gutenberg because it&#8217;s supposed to be a true WYSIWYG editor. A true what you see is what you get, editor. I think that the answer to this is, yes, you can see a live preview without actually saving the changes on the front end of your site. But you don&#8217;t actually have to reload anything. You don&#8217;t have to open it up in a new window. You don&#8217;t have to, like, actively click “please show me a preview” because what you see in your editing screen should be what you see at the end of your app as an end-user.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Matías [14:28]: Yeah, that&#8217;s the sort of the main gist to it. Yes, the site editor is built so that it always reflects the front end as truly as possible, so that&#8217;s one layer. Also, the preview tools should allow you to see in different devices like mobile breakpoints, and I don&#8217;t know if they will have breakpoints and stuff like that. There are a lot of things in the current interface that is just not enabled. There are some challenges in the sidebar. Because the site editor is not just focused on a single post, it&#8217;s focused on the entire site. So, there can be many, many changes that need to be shadowed for the site.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;re changing the site title, some of the global styles, aspects, and so on need to be orchestrated. So, to see in the previewing new window, there are some challenges there to integrate. Again, the interface is not final yet; a lot of these things are still being tweaked and improved. There are many things from the regular post editor that are not enabled yet. But they will be enabled. So yeah, it&#8217;s a, I guess, it&#8217;s not a simple thing to answer. Because, again, the idea of previewing the site that&#8217;s core to the whole project is that you&#8217;re always interacting in the same way that when you&#8217;re in the customizer, you&#8217;re seeing the preview all the time. That&#8217;s the main scope of this project,</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Josepha [15:54]: Excellent. Changes like that changes to your workflow can be really hard to get your mind around, especially if part of that existing workflow was there to create some confidence in what you&#8217;re seeing with your users. And so I understand. Now that I&#8217;ve researched that question a bit, I see where that&#8217;s coming from. Based on existing workflows and existing patterns that we have for ourselves in WordPress, will we need to have a theme to use the full site editor?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Matías [16:33]: I think we&#8217;ve already covered some of these. And again, they are tools that can work on any existing theme. There is other stuff that needs space-specific themes to opt-in into these tools, like blog templates and so on.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Josepha [16:50]: Yes, I think the question that we have next, because I see that the literal next question I have is actually something we have covered; just because we&#8217;re being pretty conversational about it, not because anyone already asked the question. So I&#8217;m actually going to skip to the last question of this section that I received. I got this next one via Twitter. The question is, “how do you view the role of themes once full site editing is fully rolled out and all the page elements (content, headers, widgets, footers, etc.) and all the views are managed via blocks and block patterns? Will things become typographic and block styles?”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Matías [17:28]: I think this is a great question because it goes to the heart of, why are we doing all this. One of the main reasons is to empower users more. WordPress has been democratizing publishing for a while; this is another step into allowing themes to get more customization tools and more control over their site if they want to. I think the recent call for testing has focused on the 404 page, for example. That&#8217;s something that forever has been locked away from users. And it&#8217;s also something that, as a theme developer, and I used to develop themes a long time ago, that was one of the things where you decide what sort of approach you take for the 404 page. Maybe sometimes you want to have something more whimsical. Sometimes you need something more serious. And committing to one when you can have such a diverse and broad user base can be challenging. With these, it becomes as easy as offering a few different patterns for that template. Then the user will always be able to change the copy and modify something. So again, it opens up a lot of these things that used to be locked down. However, from a theme perspective, I think this doesn&#8217;t reduce the theme at all. If anything, it allows the theme to focus less on coding and functions and more on design expression and aesthetics. I don&#8217;t think that would ever be exhausted. That will always remain as diverse as humans are interacting with WordPress. And so it&#8217;s not that I don&#8217;t see it&#8217;s just as like, typographic and block styles. How do you express a template, how do you express the structure, what choices you quote, what choices you make as a theme builder? And of course, there are many degrees of control there. Because a site maintainer may not want the 404 template to be editable, that sort of control will always be present.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Josepha [19:38]: Yeah. And really fast. I have to add a caveat to a thing that you said in there. For anyone who&#8217;s listening keenly, you may have heard Matías say that the users can update any of the content there &#8211; any of the copy. In this context, we&#8217;re talking about users as in the people who are maintaining the site, not people who are visiting your site. Visitors to your site will not be able to change any copy on your page unless you&#8217;ve done something very interesting with your WordPress site, which is also fine if that&#8217;s what you prefer to do. By default, your visitors can&#8217;t change everything on your website, which is good news, frankly.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I&#8217;ve got one logistics question, which I&#8217;m happy to take. And then one is kind of a big picture question that I also got from Twitter. “What about the classic editor block; what is going to happen to that? And when will we know?” So ages and ages ago, before COVID? I think so. Probably maybe a couple of years ago, Matt said that the classic editor plugin would be supported through the end of 2021. And that is still the case; there will be active support on that through the end of 2021. After that, it will not be actively supported anymore. It won&#8217;t be removed from any place that you can get access to right now. In a “this is the end of its lifecycle” sort of way, we just won&#8217;t have anyone who is currently committed to maintaining that plugin anymore. So that&#8217;s what&#8217;s happening at the end of the year. And yeah, at the end of 2021. The big question that we have is, “why is full site editing being so rushed?” I think this is a bit of a loaded question.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Matías [21:32]: Yeah, I think I think it&#8217;s still a fair question, though. I think we&#8217;re dealing with two things here. And one is ensuring that we release things in the best state possible. And also, some of the urgency is to offer tools that we know that people lack right now and that could really benefit from. Making that determination is very tricky. The full site editing project has been in the works for the last couple of years. If we count the initial phase of Gutenberg, that&#8217;s four to five years. We&#8217;ve been doing many calls for testing, which I think have been super useful to catch issues and reflect as a community on where things are going; how do we integrate with these? How do we use it? What are the shortcomings? What do we need to do? Based on all of these, we&#8217;ll continue to make decisions on when things become ready. We&#8217;re not committed to releasing something that&#8217;s not in a good state. And I think we will always be very careful about that. There are these two competing senses of the urgency &#8211; of getting some of these tools out, and because it also benefits from the feedback loops. I always say that, in many ways, the initial phase of Gutenberg, to me, is not finished. We took the initial two years to do the 5.0 release, the initial block editor, and so on. But, it&#8217;s still being improved at a very fast pace, among all the recent major releases improvements to the editor were included; that will continue to be the case. In many ways, phase one is not finished. And the moment we choose to release some of these tools or editing tools, it won&#8217;t be finished either. They will need to continue to grow, mature, and incorporate a lot of the feedback. Even the things that the ecosystem is building around. I&#8217;ve seen a few themes already that are incorporating a blank canvas template so that you can use them in some pages and take over and do everything with blocks. So even the community and ecosystem as a whole is also sort of paving the way for what needs to come.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Josepha [24:06]: I think from my perspective, and of course, I&#8217;m on the people side of things, the communication side of things, the logistics side of things; I have a frequently a very different view from what a lot of other folks are seeing. And so from my side of things, I have to say, I&#8217;m communicating about this change in a really broad way, which has not been happening since 2019 when we started the work. We&#8217;ve been communicating broadly with the WordPress community, but not with everybody who uses WordPress. So, I think that for a lot of people, this looks like a project that we started really actively working on in the last six months or so. And now we&#8217;re just racing toward a finish line. I think that there&#8217;s, there&#8217;s not been a lot of awareness of everything that&#8217;s gone into it. And so, on the one hand, it feels a little less rushed to me knowing the full length of the history on this. But also, as you said, I really think that this gets a bunch of tools to people who otherwise have not been able to accomplish these things in WordPress or otherwise. I am so anxious to get something to people who really can benefit from this change the most. And it&#8217;s the nature of the open source, right that like, one, as long as you have users, you&#8217;re going to have stuff you have to fix in your software. So we&#8217;re never really, really going to be done with this; there&#8217;s not going to be like a done point of WordPress. And the second thing is, I think it&#8217;s generally true that you don&#8217;t really start getting full user feedback until after you have launched your major release. I think that we see that a lot in open source software; you can bring in as many people as you think you can in your user tests heading up to it. And in your accessibility tests. And, in general, quality assurance tests. You can bring in a lot of people and still not have gotten the full understanding of the various niche use cases that your users will bring to you. Because at this point, we&#8217;re like 40% of the web. And that means that we&#8217;re serving this majority collection of increasingly minority voices and niche voices in the space. And so, a little bit I feel a sense of urgency; I feel a bit of anxiousness about trying to get this out there for one, to get the tools in the hands of the people who can benefit the most from them, but also so that we can start really getting the full stress test of this software out and get that feedback in so that we can really build something responsive to what our users need our long tail, “anyone who ever uses WordPress ever,” definition of users. And so, that&#8217;s why I feel a sense of urgency around it. Even though you know, as I said, you and I have been working on this for like five years, and you&#8217;ve been working on it for a decade or something. I actually don&#8217;t know how long it&#8217;s been worked on.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Matías [27:35]: Now that makes me feel a bit old.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Josepha [27:40]: Nobody makes Matías feel old. He is a lovely, wonderful colleague. Sorry, Matías, If I made you feel old.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Matías [27:46]: No, that&#8217;s totally fine. I also want to add that full site editing is not like a single toggle that&#8217;s going to drop into a major release. So I think that&#8217;s important to consider, I think this entire year is going to see a lot of these tools being, and sometimes the sort of the end-user is not the, again, the site maintainer. Still, you can also be the theme developer; I think there are many tools that would be empowering for theme developers to use. Again, we mentioned there are like five to ten themes, block themes right now. That needs to grow a lot, and that only grows through these sorts of feedback loops. And the theme community pushing things forward and seeing where things can lead to. I&#8217;m very excited about the pattern directory integration because I think that can also combine with blog themes in very powerful ways. Imagine if, I don&#8217;t know many of these patterns that are very common on the web and very needed, that if we can refine them together with a second community and make them available across themes, you can combine a header from one theme with a content of another; all these sorts of mixtures could happen. All of this needs exploration, the creativity of the entire community, and so on. In that sense, getting all these tools, even if it doesn&#8217;t immediately change anything for like the site itself, starts to unlock a lot of things.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Josepha [29:27]: I&#8217;m going to take a bit of your answer from there and tie it all the way back to your first answer that we had when you joined me today. And say, I think you&#8217;re absolutely right. We have a set of users in our theme authors and our plugin developers as well that we desperately need to get looking at this set of tools. I hope that what we are shipping in the first iteration of this serves as an opportunity for all of those theme authors and agency owners, plugin authors, WordPress site configurers freelancers. Like, I really hope that this puts it into a really accessible, easy-to-access space for them so that they can do those experiments based on what they know their users need the most. They are the group that has the closest access to site maintainers. And what they need compared to, for instance, me or a potential you like we have a lot of information, you and I, we do a lot of tests, we have a strong sense of what is needed at the moment, but we don&#8217;t have as a close connection that our theme and agency and plugin folks all have. And so that&#8217;s another part of why I&#8217;m so excited to get this out in the current iteration of it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Josepha [31:04]: That was a lot of questions in a little bit of time. This is going to be officially my longest WordPress briefing. Matías, I am so glad that you were able to join me today. And I think that everyone&#8217;s going to be really, really excited to hear your answers to these questions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Matías [31:23]: Thank you for having me.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Josepha [31:25]: All right, my friends. That brings us into our small list of big things. I&#8217;m going to skip our community highlight today just because we had a slightly longer word press briefing in our bonus iteration today. But the small list of big things. The first thing is WordCamp Central America is coming up on April 15; there is a registration link in the show notes that you can access your tickets with. I recommend that you go; we&#8217;ve got a lot of excellent speakers coming up there and a lot of good content and good training and learning for y&#8217;all. The second thing is that Matt Mullenweg and I have listening hours coming up with the community in the first week of April. I&#8217;ll add the link to register for those in the show notes as well; it&#8217;s just a few minutes for you all to stop by, check-in, see what&#8217;s going on, and share some celebrations or concerns with us. And I hope that I see you there.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So that my friends is your small list of big things. Thank you for joining in today for the WordPress briefing. I&#8217;m your host, Josepha Haden Chomphosy.

This week, the discussion&rsquo;s facilitator, H&eacute;ctor Prieto, <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2021/03/25/discussion-summary-dropping-support-for-ie11/\">confirmed</a> the majority of participants are in agreement to move forward and set a timeline for discontinuing support. Contributors are now considering either the 5.8. or 5.9 release.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;The argument for dropping in 5.8 is to realize the change and improvement quicker, while others are inclined to wait until 5.9 to provide a longer window between the official announcement and the effective date,&rdquo; Prieto said. The final call is up the the 5.8 release team, which has not yet been identified.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The release scope and schedule hinges on whether or not the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/updates/2021/03/12/full-site-editing-pre-merge-overview/\">April go/no-go conditions</a> are met for including full-site editing in the merge for 5.8 (July 2021) or 5.9 (December 2021). Teams for 5.8 will be finalized in April/May, and they will decide how to proceed for discontinuing IE11.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Jb Audras suggested that if 5.8 release leads elect to drop support for IE11,  he could work with other contributors to update the BrowseHappy notice in one of the upcoming minor versions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;Even if the BrowseHappy notice can be updated independently from&nbsp;Core&nbsp;releases, I think it&rsquo;s better to update alongside a release, to give better visibility to this change,&rdquo; Audras said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Microsoft 365 apps and services will no longer support IE11 <a href=\"https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-365-blog/microsoft-365-apps-say-farewell-to-internet-explorer-11-and/ba-p/1591666\">beginning August 17, 2021</a>. Drupal recently went through a similar process of deciding to drop IE11 support with the upcoming Drupal 10 release, anticipated in June 2022. Those who have to use IE11 retain the option to remain on Drupal 9&rsquo;s LTS release until the end of 2023. Participants in the <a href=\"https://www.drupal.org/project/drupal/issues/3155358\">discussion</a> cited many of the same considerations now facing WordPress contributors.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Matt Mullenweg <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2021/03/04/discussion-dropping-support-for-ie11/#comment-40870\">commented</a> on the preliminary discussion to suggest giving IE11 users a path forward if they land on wp-admin using an unsupported browser: </p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>Supportive of dropping support, and if someone visits on an explicitly dropped browser like IE11 showing them a friendly message saying why wp-admin&nbsp;is not accessible and next steps they can take.</p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>The technical implementation is being discussed in the <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/48743\">ticket</a> Riad Benguella created to discourage IE11 usage and WordPress&rsquo; projects and teams will begin examining the practical implications of dropping support.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Fri, 26 Mar 2021 23:32:33 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:20;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:95:\"WPTavern: 10up Creates Classic Post Migration Route With Its Convert to Blocks WordPress Plugin\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:30:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=114406\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:235:\"https://wptavern.com/10up-creates-classic-post-migration-route-with-its-convert-to-blocks-wordpress-plugin?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=10up-creates-classic-post-migration-route-with-its-convert-to-blocks-wordpress-plugin\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:3803:\"<p class=\"has-drop-cap\">Yesterday, 10up officially announced <a href=\"https://10up.com/blog/2021/convert-to-blocks/\">Convert to Blocks</a>, a WordPress plugin for transforming classic posts into blocks. The goal is to provide users with a safe migration route for old content while removing the burdens of other options in the space.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I briefly mentioned this plugin in an <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/ask-the-bartender-how-to-bulk-convert-classic-wordpress-posts-to-blocks\">article covering bulk conversion</a> in the Ask the Bartender series. However, I could not recommend it to most users because it was <a href=\"https://github.com/10up/convert-to-blocks\">hosted on GitHub</a>, a site that is geared toward developers. With it now officially in the WordPress plugin directory, it is a much more user-friendly option.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Most conversion options either convert posts in bulk or through a manual process, such as the user clicking a button. Bulk converters can be problematic at a large scale simply because there is no reliable way for users to check the success of each post&rsquo;s conversion to blocks. Of course, users could check these posts individually, but that is impractical when dealing with more than a few dozen posts.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bulk converters are also done so in conjunction with a database backup. It is sensible to do this when altering large amounts of content at once just to be on the safe side.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;We saw a space for a third way &mdash; a solution that eliminates editors stumbling upon Classic blocks and needing to know how to convert them, while also holding back on content transformation until content needs to be modified &mdash; at which point it is also, typically, checked again on the front end of the site,&rdquo; <a href=\"https://10up.com/blog/2021/convert-to-blocks/\">wrote Darshan Sawardekar</a>, a 10up lead web engineer, in the announcement.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s where the idea for Convert to Blocks came into play. It began as a creative engineering solution to mitigate risk and improve content mapping. Its success inspired the development and public release of the plugin to help others facilitate safe content migrations to the WordPress block editor.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>10up&rsquo;s solution is a bit of a middle ground. It only converts a post when a user enters the editing screen for it. From that point, the user can check whether the conversion looks correct, fix any problems if they arise, and save the post.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />Converted gallery post.\n\n\n\n<p>Essentially, it works the same as the default convert-to-blocks options in WordPress without the manual step.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For many users, this is the ideal solution. Because classic content works the same as it always has on the front end, it is unnecessary to convert it unless the need to edit the post also arises.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Convert to Blocks also adds a new column to the manage posts screen named &ldquo;Editor.&rdquo; It lists whether the post content was created with either the block or classic editor, providing users with an at-a-glance look without checking posts individually.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />Additional &ldquo;Editor&rdquo; column on the manage posts screen.\n\n\n\n<p>Like other plugins, Convert to Blocks uses the core transformation feature, which is an imperfect solution.

I&rsquo;m now on the Free Software Foundation Board of Directors once again. We were working on a video to announce this with, but that turned out to be difficult, we didn&rsquo;t have experience doing that sort of thing so it didn&rsquo;t get finished but here is the announcement. Some of you will be happy at this, and some might be disappointed, but who knows? In any case, that&rsquo;s how it is, and I&rsquo;m not planning to resign a second time.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2019, Stallman <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/gpl-author-richard-stallman-resigns-from-free-software-foundation\">resigned</a> as director of the board and president of the FSF, and was subsequently <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/gnu-project-maintainers-move-to-oust-richard-stallman-from-leadership\">ousted by GNU project maintainers</a> from his position as head of the project. Calls for his removal were precipitated by Stallman&rsquo;s controversial remarks on rape, assault, and child sex trafficking, along with two decades of <a href=\"https://geekfeminism.wikia.org/wiki/Richard_Stallman\">behaviors and statements</a> that many have found to be disturbing and offensive. His return came as a shock to the free software community, though some suspect he never really left.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;I did not support the decision to reinstate RMS,&rdquo; former FSF board member Kat Walsh <a href=\"https://twitter.com/mindspillage/status/1374448587388588037\">said</a> after resigning from the board yesterday. &ldquo;I made my arguments and placed my opposing vote; while I was glad I was able to do that I regret not being able to turn the decision the other way.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;I wish the organization well; my departure is not a rejection of the ideas of free software, only a belief that my role in the organization was no longer the best way to put them forward into the world.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Stallman&rsquo;s reinstatement came with a staggering lack of transparency from FSF&rsquo;s board of directors and has triggered a cascade of condemnation from individuals and organizations across the tech industry. Among the many critical responsibilities it maintains, the FSF currently&nbsp;<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_Software_Foundation#History\" target=\"_blank\">holds the copyrights to enforce the GPL</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Open Source Initiative published a <a href=\"https://opensource.org/OSI_Response\">statement</a> this week, calling for Stallman&rsquo;s removal from FSF&rsquo;s leadership:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>The Open Source Initiative calls upon the Free Software Foundation to hold Stallman responsible for past behavior, remove him from the organization&rsquo;s leadership and work to address the harm he caused to all those he has excluded: those he considers less worthy, and those he has hurt with his words and actions. We will not participate in any events that include Richard M. Stallman and we cannot collaborate with the Free Software Foundation until Stallman is removed from the organization&rsquo;s leadership. &nbsp;</p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Red Hat <a href=\"https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/red-hat-statement-about-richard-stallmans-return-free-software-foundation-board?sc_cid=701f2000000tyBjAAI\">announced</a> that it is suspending all funding of the FSF and any FSF-hosted events. Mozilla <a href=\"https://twitter.com/mozilla/status/1374513444838199304\">joined</a> the Open Source Diversity Community, Outreachy, and the Software Conservancy project in supporting an <a href=\"https://rms-open-letter.github.io/\">open letter</a> that calls for the removal of the entire Board of the Free Software Foundation, along with the removal of Stallman from all leadership positions, including the GNU Project. The letter states that the undersigned do not acknowledge Stallman&rsquo;s leadership of the FSF and do not condone his actions and opinions:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>There has been enough tolerance of RMS&rsquo;s repugnant ideas and behavior. We cannot continue to let one person ruin the meaning of our work. Our communities have no space for people like Richard M. Stallman, and we will not continue suffering his behavior, giving him a leadership role, or otherwise holding him and his hurtful and dangerous ideology as acceptable.</p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p> The petition has been signed by more than 2400 free software advocates. Notable signatories include Molly de Blanc (Debian Project, GNOME Foundation), Elana Hashman (Debian Technical Committee Member, Open Source Initiative Director, Kubernetes SIG Instrumentation Chair), Neil McGovern (GNOME Foundation Executive Director, Former Debian Project Leader), and Luis Villa (Former Director of the Open Source Initiative and the GNOME Foundation; contributor to the GPL v3 drafting process).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) published a <a href=\"https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2021/03/statement-re-election-richard-stallman-fsf-board\">statement</a> urging the voting members&nbsp;of the FSF board to call a special meeting to reconsider Stallman&rsquo;s reinstatement, in support of the &ldquo;long-term viability of the free software movement:&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>Free software is a vital component of an open and just technological society: its key institutions and individuals cannot place misguided feelings of loyalty above their commitment to that cause. The movement for digital freedom is larger than any one individual contributor, regardless of their role. Indeed, we hope that this moment can be an opportunity to bring in new leaders and new ideas to the free software movement.</p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Stallman still has many staunch supporters, as more than 2,000 people have signed an <a href=\"https://rms-support-letter.github.io/\">open letter</a> in support of him and his leadership. They contend that removing RMS &ldquo;will hurt FSF&rsquo;s image and will deal a significant blow to the momentum of the free software movement.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Stallman is still listed among the <a href=\"https://www.fsf.org/about/staff-and-board\">FSF&rsquo;s board of directors</a>, but the board appears to be reorganizing. A preliminary <a href=\"https://www.fsf.org/news/preliminary-board-statement-on-fsf-governance\">statement</a> on upcoming changes to the board&rsquo;s governance said they are moving to adopt a transparent, formal process for identifying candidates and appointing new board members. The board intends to require existing board members to submit to this process as well &ldquo;to decide which of them remain on the board,&rdquo; with a deadline of 30 days to complete the changes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>By allowing Stallman to resume his position, the FSF squandered the opportunity it had to redefine itself following his resignation in 2019. The organization missed the chance to carve out a new future that would be free from his damaging influence. If the board doesn&rsquo;t act in the best interests of the greater community, by remedying its lack of transparency and accountability, it may permanently resign the organization to irrelevance.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Fri, 26 Mar 2021 05:46:39 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:22;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:67:\"Gutenberg Times: Full-site Editing MVP: Can I Build a Landing Page?\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:35:\"https://gutenbergtimes.com/?p=17337\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:76:\"https://gutenbergtimes.com/full-site-editing-mvp-can-i-build-a-landing-page/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:6562:\"<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy</strong> was the featured guest on the <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/podcast/1-josepha-haden-chomphosy-on-the-past-present-and-future-of-wordpress\">inaugural episode of the WPTavern Jukebox podcast</a>, hosted by <strong>Nathan Wrigley</strong>. In their conversation, they covered a lot of ground. The show is definitely worth your 40 minutes of listen. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Around minute 23 of the audio they talked a bit more about Full-Site Editing and its merge into the core. Chomphosy said she knows &#8216;this summer&#8217; is an ambitions goal, and she also assured the listeners that the team won&#8217;t release something that&#8217;s not functional and usable. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Go/NoGo Mid to End of April</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The Core release and Gutenberg teams will make the Go/NoGo decision to merge Full-Site Editing for the next WordPress release in July (5.8)  on April 17 or on April 23.  In other words, the state of Full Site editing in Gutenberg plugin version 10.4 and 10.5.  If it doesn&#8217;t get merged into 5.8, Full-Site Editing will be merged in WordPress 5.9 to be released in December 2021</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Chomphosy also shared her &#8211; unofficial &#8211; benchmark of what should be possible with the prototype of the Site Editor by April: Can you &#8211; without writing code &#8211; create a landing page with Full-site editing tools. She calls it &#8220;the smallest viable sentence. The I-AM of websites.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>A Landing page is the smallest viable unit</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>This single web page consists of a header, a footer, a hero image with a button, some text, a form or a call to action.  This narrows the focus of the MVP, the prototype, considerably. It also increases the probability that the first low-key, opt-in version of Full-Site editing might actually make it into the next WordPress version. A narrow scope will also help content creators, teachers and developers get started working on their discovery of the new WordPress feature. As soon as it is merged into WordPress core, plugin developer and theme builders can test their ideas against it and get familiar with the underlying concepts. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s a good way to ease-in content creators, too. When you are not dealing with the header and footer of a big site, but just for a single page, it’s not so critical if you get lost on the way from content editing to template part (header, footer) editing and back again. It&#8217;s all on the same page, literally. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>This transition was one of the major causes of confusion during the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2021/03/16/high-level-feedback-from-the-fse-program-march/\">first few testing calls for the FSE outreach program</a> and the developers are working on making it less confusing. With this unofficial benchmark of a single landing page creation, the team will have additional time and input on how to better handle that switch between editing a template that is used for many pages and the content of a single post or page content.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A very tangible goal, &#8220;Can I build a landing page with the tools available?&#8221; makes it straightforward for WordPress contributors who work on the parts that make that are not code, like documentation, marketing, training and testing.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Call For Testing: Create a Header</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/test/2021/03/25/fse-program-testing-call-4-building-a-restaurant-themed-header/\">4th call for testing</a> via the WordPress FSE-Outreach program asks you to<a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/test/2021/03/25/fse-program-testing-call-4-building-a-restaurant-themed-header/\"> create a header for a Restaurant</a>. <strong>Anne McCarthy</strong> has detailed instructions for you as well as video if you are in a testing mood. Your input is definitely wanted!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Chomphosy also added that Matias Ventura, the technical lead for Gutenberg,  might have different benchmarks for the MVP. I am curious, and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/JosephaHaden/status/1371956586516606977\">answer Josepha&#8217;s call for questions</a> on Full-Site Editing for her next episode of the WPBriefing podcast when Matias will be her guest. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Full-Side Editing project encompasses a lot more than the Site Editor with template parts. There are Global Styles, Widgets in Customizer, a new Navigation and Widget screen, block-based themes with a theme.json file and query block. Some of it will work its way into the MVP. We will see how far the team progresses on their journey, that will only begin once Full-Site editing comes to Millions of WordPress users. No Fear, though. It will all be opt-in. Nothing will break. </p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-white-color has-secondary-background-color has-text-color has-background has-large-font-size\">&#8220;Given enough eyeballs, all bugs are shallow&#8221; &#8212; Eric Raymond&#8217;s Linus&#8217; Law</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-group has-secondary-background-color has-background\"><div class=\"wp-block-group__inner-container\">\n<form class=\"wp-block-newsletterglue-form ngl-form ngl-portrait\" action=\"https://gutenbergtimes.com/feed/\" method=\"post\"><div class=\"ngl-form-container\"><div class=\"ngl-form-field\"><label class=\"ngl-form-label\" for=\"ngl_email\">Leave Your Email for our Weekend Edition</label><div class=\"ngl-form-input\"><input type=\"email\" class=\"ngl-form-input-text\" name=\"ngl_email\" id=\"ngl_email\" /></div></div><button class=\"ngl-form-button\">Subscribe</button><p class=\"ngl-form-text\">We hate spam, too.

The company officially acquired the plugin months ago. However, this was its first public outing as the new owner of a project that has seen a steady uptick in its popularity, recently surpassing 5,000 active installations.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Extendify was busy in late 2020. The company quietly purchased the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/redux-framework/\">Redux Framework</a> in November. D&#333;vy Paukstys, the creator, remained on board part-time with the financial backing needed to continue the project. In December, Extendify joined forces with Munir Kamal and his team behind Editor Plus and Gutenberg Hub.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;Our mission is to turn WordPress into a superpower for entrepreneurs around the world,&rdquo; said Extendify co-founder Chris Lubkert. &ldquo;As you know, despite its unrivaled popularity, many users still struggle to use WordPress to create the site they need. We see tremendous potential to empower WordPress users to create a Gutenberg-native website in a few clicks. By bringing together Redux, Editor Plus, and Gutenberg Hub, we have the foundational pieces to create a world-class onboarding and site-building experience.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are no plans to build a &ldquo;super&rdquo; plugin that combines Editor Plus and Redux. Gutenberg Hub will continue providing resources to help users leverage the block editor.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;Currently, the Redux template library and the library in Editor Plus are separate,&rdquo; said Lubkert. &ldquo;But we are heavily investing in making the Extendify library the best solution for users and eventually plan to introduce this to the Redux user base as well.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Extendify&rsquo;s first public act as Editor Plus&rsquo;s owner was not to introduce new features in its recent major-release, version 2.7. Instead, users were presented with a limitation on features they previously had access to for free.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Version 2.7 limits the template and pattern inserter, <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/editor-plus-2-6-adds-block-pattern-and-template-library\">introduced in 2.6</a>, to three imports. Beyond that, users must upgrade to one of the Extendify Pro paid tiers. The single-site option is $99 per year with an introductory rate of $49. The unlimited sites tier is $299, and it currently has a $149 limited-time offer.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />Template and pattern inserter.\n\n\n\n<p>At first glance, it seemed like a cash grab from new owners. There were no public announcements or explanations for the change outside of a minor note in the plugin&rsquo;s change log &mdash; just new ownership and upsells. Lubkert said he plans to rectify this by publishing an announcement post next week.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Extendify had already been involved with new feature development for months. The API behind the template inserter was coming from their server in Editor Plus 2.6. It was the groundwork for Extendify Pro, but it was also still under development.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re a small, nimble team, and it was a development timing issue,&rdquo; said Lubkert. &ldquo;We finished the library approximately three weeks before we finished paid plans, and we certainly didn&rsquo;t want to delay users getting their hands on the library while we finished up work on Extendify Pro.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Users will not lose any previously-imported templates. However, importing anything beyond three additional templates in Editor Plus 2.7 or newer will require a purchase of Extendify Pro for an API key.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;We are now offering an added layer of value for users who want to benefit from the power of Editor Plus but may not be in a position to use it to create their site from scratch,&rdquo; said Lubkert. &ldquo;For those users, we are creating the most beautiful and effective Gutenberg-native templates, built with Editor Plus, as part of the Extendify Pro template library. As you know, we launched the initial beta version a few weeks ago. A subscription is required for unlimited access to the library, but all users can import any three templates or patterns for free.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>With the launch of the template inserter in 2.6, there was no public mention of it being a beta version.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Templates and patterns from Gutenberg Hub remain free. Users can still browse the site, copy a template code snippet, and paste it into the block editor.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The team removed the custom blocks extension in Editor Plus 2.7.1, released earlier today. This feature allowed end-users to copy blocks from the Gutenberg Hub block library, paste them into the plugin, and save them for use on the site. Users could also add custom blocks via this settings screen.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />Removed custom block feature.\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;The custom block feature in Editor Plus was an experiment that was pretty cool, actually,&rdquo; said Lubkert. &ldquo;However, [Kamal] suggested removing it from Editor Plus since it is now very similar to the reusable block functionality in core. We want Editor Plus to push the envelope of what is possible with Gutenberg, and having a duplicate feature that is available in core doesn&rsquo;t add real, incremental value for our users.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Updating to 2.7+ will also likely deactivate the plugin for end-users. The primary plugin filename changed from <code>index.php</code> to <code>editorplus.php</code>. Developers should generally avoid doing this because WordPress uses this filename to determine if a plugin is active.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I remain optimistic about Editor Plus&rsquo;s future now that it has the financial backing it deserves. Having been an early supporter of the project, I knew this day would come. Nearly every time I spoke with Kamal in the past, I asked him about plans for monetizing the product. It had grown beyond what one developer could reasonably handle and scale without a business plan in place.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;We agree with your sentiment that WordPress projects need to generate revenue in order to fund the development of truly transformational experiences,&rdquo; said Lubkert. &ldquo;We have been investing in our team as well. Tammie Lister joined us as Head of Design.

Our passionate and resilient community members are pulling out all stops this year to continue the good work. We already have two applications for do_action events in the queue, with more in the pipeline! This post aims to encourage all our zealous organizers with tips on how best to organize successful <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/community/handbook/meetup-organizer/event-formats/do_action-charity-hackathon/organising-an-online-do_action-event/\">online do_action charity hackathons</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<ol><li><strong>Recruit a core team and prepare an event plan</strong><br />Enlist a team of 5-10 members to wrangle the event. Much like a WordCamp, organizers need to plan do_action events down to the last detail. Make sure you have a plan for the entire event lifecycle &#8211; including <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/community/handbook/meetup-organizer/event-formats/do_action-charity-hackathon/gathering-non-profits/\">selecting nonprofits</a>, <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/community/handbook/meetup-organizer/event-formats/do_action-charity-hackathon/getting-particpants/\">finding volunteers</a>, <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/community/handbook/meetup-organizer/event-formats/do_action-charity-hackathon/finding-sponsors/\">finding sponsors</a>, task management, and execution. For inspiration, check out how the <a href=\"https://github.com/doactionjp/do_action_guideline\">do_action Japan team came up with a plan for the event beforehand</a>! Having a solid communication strategy and setting deadlines is equally important. Finding answers to questions like: “<em>When do volunteer teams meet?”,  “How often should there be check-ins?”,  “How do we track tasks?”,  “How do we measure progress?” </em>and<em> “ What deadlines do we need to meet?” </em>for instance, will help in devising a strategy.</li><li><strong>Finding non-profits and volunteers </strong><br /><a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/community/handbook/meetup-organizer/event-formats/do_action-charity-hackathon/gathering-non-profits/\">Finding eligible non-profits</a> for your event could be a challenge. When your event publishes the call for non-profits, share it widely on social media. Since this is a charitable event, we have noticed that getting PR from local news media outlets is a lot easier. You might also want to reach out to Non-profit organizations and offer assistance proactively. You can follow the same approach for volunteer recruitment too.</li><li><strong>Fix your collaboration tools and communication strategy<br /></strong>Since this will be an online event, you will need the right collaboration tools to make the event successful. <strong>Please note: A doaction.org G Suite/Google Workspace account will be provided to all do_action event organizers in 2021 and beyond! Feel free to use that account for all your needs. Check out </strong><a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/community/handbook/meetup-organizer/event-formats/do_action-charity-hackathon/google-workspace-account-for-do_action-events/\"><strong>the handbook page for more information</strong></a><strong>.</strong> Here are some tools that you can use for your event:<ul><li>doaction.org website (call for nonprofits &amp; hackathon participants)</li><li>Slack (overall event prep, communication on the event days) &#8211; A free plan will be sufficient.</li><li>Zoom (event organizer &amp; inter-team meetings, opening/closing remarks) &#8211; <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/community/handbook/meetup-organizer/getting-started/special-virtual-events-zoom-request/\">WordPress Community zoom accounts</a> can be used. </li><li><a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/community/handbook/meetup-organizer/event-formats/do_action-charity-hackathon/google-workspace-account-for-do_action-events/\">Google Workspace tools</a> (provided to all 2021 organizers in the <a href=\"mailto:location@doaction.org\">location@doaction.org</a> format) &#8211; Gmail (inquiries &amp; sponsor communication), Google Forms (call for organizers &amp; sponsors, post-event survey), Google Sheets (task &amp; data management), Google Docs (collaborative editing of documents, Google Drive (for storage needs),  and Google Slides (opening/closing remarks presentation)</li><li>WordPress.com P2 &#8211; for task management</li><li>Trello &#8211; for task management.</li><li>Figma (design)</li></ul></li><li><strong>Finding sponsors<br /></strong>For online do_action events, organizers need not worry about venue or catering expenses. Hence, sponsorship benefits for these events can be passed along directly to non-profits. Most WordPress companies are passionate about supporting non-profits, and providing product/service licenses is a cost-effective way for them to support the community. Consider reaching out to specific companies as per your needs. Sponsorship benefits that do_action events in 2020 had availed include:<ul><li>Free domain and web hosting for non-profits</li><li>Sponsored premium plugins and themes (Only 100% GPL Compliant themes and plugins are allowed)</li><li>Sponsored website services (backups, caching, security, optimization, etc.)</li></ul></li><li><strong>Find a way to offer post-event support for non-profit websites<br /></strong>Make sure that once the event is over, each non-profit is trained on how to use and update the site. Perhaps a few volunteers could provide post-event support for a short while (while ensuring that the right expectations are set on both sides). Offering post-event support as a sponsorship benefit could also be a solution to that problem.</li></ol>\n\n\n\n<p>Does all of this sound exciting?

The goal was simple: allow users to insert icons nearly anywhere in the block editor at the click of a button.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The plugin uses version 4.7 of the Font Awesome library out of the box. However, developers can modify this to include custom icon sets.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Like many of the most useful plugins, it stays in its lane, performing a simple task and doing it well. The plugin presents users with a &ldquo;flag&rdquo; button in the editor toolbar whenever they edit a Rich Text field.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />Inserting an icon into a Heading block.\n\n\n\n<p>Rich Text is a block editor component for entering text. Anywhere users can type in the editor canvas is fair game for inserting an icon. This includes paragraphs, headings, image captions, and more. It also extends to blocks from other plugin developers. If they employ a Rich Text field anywhere, the &ldquo;flag&rdquo; button will appear, and users can plop an icon in it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Icons inserted through the plugin automatically inherit the surrounding text size. If you stick it in a Heading block, it will grow larger. If you stick it in a Button block, it will match up with the Button text. The same is true for the colors too.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />Inserting icons in various blocks at different sizes and colors.\n\n\n\n<p>Because it is impossible to match each theme&rsquo;s design perfectly, some minor spacing or alignment adjustments may be needed. For the most part, the icons looked good when I tested them with various themes. However, there were a couple of one-pixel-off issues and minor alignment miscues with some blocks. On the whole, I did not run into any design-breaking issues. The plugin displayed its icons as it should.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One usability issue I encountered was being unable to delete an icon via the <code>Backspace</code> or <code>Delete</code> keys on my keyboard in use with the Buttons block. It worked well with other blocks. The solution for this was to click on the inserted icon. Then, select the &ldquo;flag&rdquo; icon in the toolbar to reopen the inserter. After choosing no replacement, the old one disappeared.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The plugin developer provided filter hooks for third-party developers to implement icon sets other than Font Awesome via a custom JSON file. Instructions are outlined in the plugin&rsquo;s readme. There are also hooks for uploading or overwriting the stylesheet and classes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While I like the plugin&rsquo;s execution, I dislike that it loads its own Font Awesome stylesheet. If using another plugin or theme that does the same, its inclusion increases the page load size for end-users by loading multiple copies of the same code. This is not the fault of the plugin developer. It is a limitation created by WordPress&rsquo;s lack of a dependency system. However, users who give the plugin a try should be mindful of this potential issue.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 24 Mar 2021 23:07:30 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:14:\"Justin Tadlock\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:26;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:62:\"WPTavern: Chrome 90 to Use HTTPS by Default in the Address Bar\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:30:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=114269\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:169:\"https://wptavern.com/chrome-90-to-use-https-by-default-in-the-address-bar?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=chrome-90-to-use-https-by-default-in-the-address-bar\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:2895:\"<p>Chrome&rsquo;s upcoming <a href=\"https://blog.chromium.org/2021/03/a-safer-default-for-navigation-https.html\">version 90</a> will use&nbsp;<em>https://</em>&nbsp;by default in the address bar, bringing a significant improvement to security and loading speed. HTTPS adoption has shot up significantly over the past six years after Google&nbsp;<a href=\"https://webmasters.googleblog.com/2014/08/https-as-ranking-signal.html\">announced</a>&nbsp;in 2014 that HTTPS would be used as a ranking signal in search results. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>In February 2021, W3Techs found that <a href=\"https://w3techs.com/blog/entry/fact_20210202\">82.2% of websites use a valid SSL certificate</a>. Today, more than <a href=\"https://transparencyreport.google.com/https/overview?hl=en\">98% of pages loaded in Chrome</a> use HTTPS as the default protocol, making this change to using HTTPS as the default for navigations long overdue. </p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><img /></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Firefox Telemetry charts HTTPS adoption at <a href=\"https://letsencrypt.org/stats/#percent-pageloads\">more than 84%</a> of web pages for all users and 92% for traffic originating in the USA.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><img /></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Currently, anytime a user puts a site into the address bar without specifying the protocol, such as &ldquo;example.com,&rdquo; Chrome uses HTTP by default and then has to retry for HTTPS. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The update in Chrome 90 is good news for Chrome users, because it improves the loading speed for sites that support HTTPS by cutting out the redirection loop after the initial load. A gif on the Chromium blog illustrates this in a nice way: </p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><img /></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Those who are using Chrome Canary can access experiments to try it out ahead of the version 90 release. Navigate to the following URL to mark the experimental feature as enabled:</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em>chrome://flags/#omnibox-default-typed-navigations-to-https</em></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><img /></div>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress site owners will want to make sure their sites are using HTTPS in order to take advantage of the speed boost this change introduces. Fortunately, for those who haven&rsquo;t migrated over yet, the latest <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-5-7-will-make-it-easier-to-migrate-from-http-to-https\">5.7 release makes it easy to update with the click of a button</a>. WordPress can detect if the site&rsquo;s hosting environment supports HTTPS and then offers a one-click update process via the Site Health screen. It even handles mixed content rewrites where possible, so site owners will not have to worry about having a bunch of broken links after migrating. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Chrome 90 went into beta in mid-March.

At the time I was obsessed with skateboarding, the website was for friends I used to hang out and ride around with from school. I remember how excited I felt when I could see that my website was online and I would literally show it to everyone I could, even though looking back at it now it was extremely brightly coloured and scrappy!</p>\n<p>Back then, with my family&#8217;s 56k connection, whenever I connected to the internet it would take over the landline, so I was only allowed to go online for an hour per day. So I spent the days fiddling with Front Page, just waiting for my 1 hour to upload the code and share the updates with my MIRC friends (kinda like a Stone Age version of Slack).</p>\n<p>That’s about the time I also picked up a guitar for the first time&#8230;.</p>\n<h3>Music, business and websites</h3>\n<p>To start I borrowed a super cheap electric guitar from a friend to learn how to play, and impress a girl I liked. After playing all evening, I felt so inspired that the guitar ended up next to me while I slept in bed. It was love at first chord.</p>\n<p>Because I was so obsessed, I couldn’t stop practicing and quickly I became pretty good (for a kid). So much so that I formed a band with some friends and started performing wherever we could. For the next decade, I focused on becoming the best rock musician I could.</p>\n<p>I didn’t want to just play the guitar in a band that was performing at local events and school, I wanted us to go places and started treating it as a business. I began studying business by reading every book I could, which led me to take courses and become a certified business and digital consultant.</p>\n<p>During my studies, I learned WordPress and the entire Adobe suite. This was my first introduction to WordPress and it made me love designing and developing websites even more than I already did.</p>\n<p>I had fun during this time, but they were some tough years and despite all of my efforts, my band wasn’t doing very well.</p>\n<blockquote><p>After everything I had put into it, I thought I’d have my own episode on MTV Cribs already!</p></blockquote>\n<p>We decided the band needed a change.</p>\n<p>We rebranded, wrote new stuff, this time in English to maximise our reach, and did an online launch using everything I learned.</p>\n<p>Within a month of the launch, my local band from a small town in Israel was signed to release an album worldwide through a British label.</p>\n<p>We were stoked!</p>\n<p>We decided to drop everything, come to the UK and start touring Europe. And so we did!</p>\n<p>Starting from scratch, we began building our audience at small venues and pubs, while really pumping things up online, using WordPress to build our website and promote!</p>\n<p>We went from playing to sometimes less than 10 people to hundreds, then thousands. Playing with some of the artists we grew up listening to.</p>\n<p>It was pretty amazing, but I was still broke surprisingly!</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://s20094.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/image1.jpg\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>Luckily though, from my efforts in promoting the band using our website and designs on social media, my work began to get noticed and I started to attract clients.</p>\n<p>With little to no money in my bank account, I started freelancing out the back of our tour van and built clients websites while touring Europe. Free McDonalds WiFi became my best friend and no matter where we went, there was always one nearby.</p>\n<p>While I drew in more clients and started generating revenue for myself, unfortunately my band ended up splitting up. It was unavoidable and in the end, it was the best thing that could have happened to me (even though it was devastating at the time).</p>\n<p>I then thought, “you know what, I’m going to start taking this freelancing thing seriously.”</p>\n<blockquote><p>I started building my own business, using my rediscovered passion for the web and WordPress in particular.</p></blockquote>\n<p>As I got deeper into building websites, I began to insert myself more into the WordPress community, which filled the void of being “the band guy”. As my time now wasn’t being taken up by touring, I employed my first designer and this is where my agency took off.</p>\n<p>We managed to pull in 6 figures within the first year, and we kept growing!</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://s20094.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/image2.jpg\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>Within a few years, my agency grew to 12 employees. As I acquired more clients, I realized there was something holding me back.</p>\n<h3>From Agency To Product Maker</h3>\n<p>As we began dealing with more and more clients day-to-day, it became blindingly apparent that we simply did not have the correct tools to deal with the volume efficiently.</p>\n<p>So, I went on the hunt for a platform or tool that could help organize and deal with client requests quickly and easily. We already had a ticketing system in place, while using emails, phone calls and face to face meetings, but it was just all a mess.</p>\n<p>There are solutions to the problems of project management BUT I struggled to find a purely dedicated platform that was for a web design agency.</p>\n<blockquote><p>I arranged a meeting with my team and we decided, let’s just build our own solution.</p></blockquote>\n<p>We had the designers and developers to make it happen, so&#8230;we did! We developed a simple WordPress plugin that we could use to take requests from our clients across all of their websites, and after it was implemented, it worked like a dream.</p>\n<p>Being the person I am though, I didn’t stop there. I thought, “other people should be using this” and that’s where my product, Atarim, was born. I reached out to the WordPress community wherever I could and got a bunch of beta testers to try it out with their own clients.</p>\n<p>The feedback was so positive that we developed the plugin even further and started charging monthly and annual plans for other agencies and freelancers to start using it. We are now a fully fledged agency management platform serving thousands of freelancers and agencies and helped deliver tens of thousands of website projects. In just short of two years.</p>\n<p>Now we only deal with a couple of legacy clients who have been with us for a while, and we use our own platform to manage them.</p>\n<h3>The WP Community</h3>\n<p>I’ve been part of the WordPress community for a long time now, and I’m humbled and honored to say that without it, my product would not be where it is today.</p>\n<p>Before COVID, I was a regular at every event I could get to, whether it was in London (where I live) or another country.</p>\n<blockquote><p>I’ve made some lifelong friends within the community and it has made working day-to-day an absolute blast</p></blockquote>\n<p>…(obviously with some major stresses in between, but hey you aren’t doing it right if you aren’t stressed most of the time!).</p>\n<p>Because of COVID though, I was driven to creating our own event online. Last year we had our first and we are currently gearing up for the second one to go live very soon!</p>\n<p>The Atarim Web Agency Summit was born out of love for the WordPress Community. An online event that spans 4 days where we can all come together and listen to some of the greatest minds in our industry talk about their craft and how we can improve our agencies and freelance businesses.</p>\n<p>We managed to develop the summit into the biggest online event in the WordPress space and it was incredibly humbling to partner with some of the largest companies and famous speakers. Companies that have products I myself have been using for years, and speakers that I used to watch on YouTube!</p>\n<p>Also, the feedback we received from our initial beta test and the feedback we continue to get from our current users, helps shape the product every single day. The WordPress community is integral for it’s success and I can’t thank it enough.</p>\n<p>I love that our platform is helping agencies and freelancers that are experiencing the exact same stresses and problems I was facing when growing my agency. This is what drives my team and I to continue working and evolving Atarim, until it is the only way to manage website projects.</p>\n<h3>What’s Next?</h3>\n<p>Next, I want to make our platform accessible on any type of website, whether it’s WordPress, Drupal, Shopify or built purely from custom HTML &amp; CSS. I want Atarim to be accessible to any type of agency owner and freelancer so they can implement our platform and reap the benefits.</p>\n<p>I’m continuing to build the team as our product gets more and more users, so we can up development on a weekly basis and release updates that enhance the experience for our current and bring in new users.</p>\n<p>As for me personally, I’m learning new and exciting things every day, attending courses and webinars where I can to ensure that I’m doing the best I can to steer Atarim in the right direction. I’ve been at this for nearly 2 years now, the plan is to go for another 8 years and re-evaluate from there.</p>\n<p>I’m excited for the future!</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://heropress.com/essays/my-journey-from-freelancer-to-product-maker/\">My Journey From Freelancer To Product Maker</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://heropress.com\">HeroPress</a>.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 24 Mar 2021 08:01:45 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:10:\"Vito Peleg\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:28;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:76:\"WPTavern: Eksell Portfolio Theme Now Available in WordPress Themes Directory\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:30:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=114120\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:197:\"https://wptavern.com/eksell-portfolio-theme-now-available-in-wordpress-themes-directory?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=eksell-portfolio-theme-now-available-in-wordpress-themes-directory\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:2805:\"<p>Anders Nor&eacute;n&rsquo;s new <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/themes/eksell/\">Eksell theme</a> is now available for download from the WordPress Themes directory. Eksell was inspired by Swedish graphic designer <a href=\"http://olleeksell.se/\">Olle Eksell</a>. It arrives a year and a half after Nor&eacute;n&rsquo;s popular Chaplin theme was released.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><img /></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Last week Justin Tadlock published a <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/compatibility-is-not-enough-the-eksell-wordpress-theme-creates-art-with-blocks\">preview</a> of the theme while it was still making its way through the review system. Since that time, Nor&eacute;n has added to the five block patterns he originally submitted with the theme. There are now 12 block patterns that help users create stacked galleries, calls to action, multiple columns with pullquotes, and more. </p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><img /></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Eksell also includes a unique &ldquo;<a href=\"https://andersnoren.se/themes/eksell/blank-canvas/\">Blank Canvas</a>&rdquo; page template that only displays content added in the block editor, which Nor&eacute;n said offers a preview of what users will be able to do once Full Site Editing (FSE) is merged into core.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.andersnoren.se/introducing-eksell/\">Eksell announcement post</a> is a sobering reminder of the uncertainty facing even the most experienced theme developers with changes coming later this year. Nor&eacute;n said he is not planning to update his existing 20 themes to support FSE:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>My current belief is that I won&rsquo;t update my existing themes to take advantage of Full Site Editing. Not because I don&rsquo;t buy into the vision of Full Site Editing, but because I don&rsquo;t think anyone would be well-served by six year old themes (like Hoffman) very much not built for FSE being updated to sorta-kinda support it. I would rather spend that time on themes built from the ground up to take advantage of the new tools Full Site Editing gives us.</p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Once FSE is released, Nor&eacute;n said themes not updated to support it will immediately feel outdated &ldquo;much like Classic Editor themes felt in the spring of 2019.&rdquo; Theme developers don&rsquo;t yet know what shape themes will take or how difficult it may be to update them once FSE is in core. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Nor&eacute;n is considering updating Eksell to bridge the gap between the world before FSE and whatever themes look like after it lands in core, but reserved the right to leave it behind with the others. For the time being, it is one of the best themes around for the block editor, but it may be the last of the truly classic themes before the dawn of a new era in theming.  </p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 24 Mar 2021 01:28:23 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:29;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:74:\"WPTavern: Refactoring Gutenberg’s Gallery Block To Support Nested Images\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:30:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=114179\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:187:\"https://wptavern.com/refactoring-gutenbergs-gallery-block-to-support-nested-images?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=refactoring-gutenbergs-gallery-block-to-support-nested-images\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:4957:\"<p class=\"has-drop-cap\">Like many others, I often have pinned tabs of all sorts of things in my browser. Some of them linger there for months. Others for years, I shamefully admit. Of the handful of Gutenberg-related browser tabs I have had <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/25940\">pinned since late 2020</a>, one of them finally had the sort of movement I have been waiting on. The Gallery block was finally getting the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2021/03/23/gallery-block-update-call-for-testing/\">much-needed refactor</a> it needed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A gallery is essentially a container with nested images. The concept of nested blocks has existed and has been in use for a long while now. However, the core Gallery block does not make use of this capability. This means that users have no access to existing Image block features.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Want to customize the link for individual images?</em> No can do with the Gallery block. Instead, users must use Columns and drop Image blocks in. It is such a fundamentally broken part of the user experience there is little wonder that users have looked outside of core WordPress for alternative solutions. And it has been a problem since the introduction of galleries via the shortcode system in WordPress 2.5.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Want to alternate styles for each image in the gallery?</em> That has traditionally been impossible too. However, when each image is an Image block, users can alternate between square and round styles, for example.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />Alternating Image block styles in a Gallery.\n\n\n\n<p>Users can even use a plugin like Editor Plus with its extended Image block styles to create a Gallery of &ldquo;image blobs&rdquo; or animate them individually.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />Individual images with &ldquo;blob&rdquo; shapes via Editor Plus.\n\n\n\n<p>This change could open some layout possibilities where users control the positioning of each item in the grid. And, why stop with images? There is no reason that core could not open the block up to other types of nesting in the future, such as videos, quotes, and more.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />Gallery of images with a quote.\n\n\n\n<p>The downside to this new feature is that it could require more work from developers who have already built on top of the Gallery block. That is why it is fundamental that they test this change now.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Testers can see the change by switching to the <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/25940\">gallery refactor branch</a> via GitHub or grab a <a href=\"https://glendaviesnz.files.wordpress.com/2021/03/gutenberg-gallery-refactor-1.zip\">ZIP file</a> of the build. It adds a new &ldquo;Gallery Refactor&rdquo; option to Gutenberg&rsquo;s Experimental setting screen, which must be enabled.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Only newly-added Gallery blocks will use the new format. Nothing changed about it at first glance. However, by selecting an individual image, users can use the typical Image block settings. The two exceptions are the align and resize options, removed because they would break the layout. New galleries also do not work in the site editor yet.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;While the expectation is nothing changes in terms of output, this is a pretty major change on a technical level for a very popular block, so it&rsquo;d be a huge help to gather as much testing feedback as possible,&rdquo; wrote Glen Davies in the announcement post.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This statement could be misleading. There are fundamental, backward-incompatible changes to the markup output with the new implementation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In previous iterations of the gallery, it had a wrapper container (<code>&lt;div&gt;</code>) and an unordered list (<code>&lt;ul&gt;</code>) of images. The proposed change would remove the list entirely, dropping the Image blocks as direct children of the containing element. This will break custom theme styles and potentially plugin integration.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On a technical level, I do not see the need to change the outer markup galleries. It is only the image part of the equation that needs to change. If this is because of limitations with the <code>InnerBlocks</code> system (nested blocks feature), perhaps it is not robust enough to meet developers&rsquo; needs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With continual breaking changes to markup and CSS in the core block system, coding the entirety of a site&rsquo;s CSS from scratch is probably a thing of the past. This is not the first instance of such breakage and will undoubtedly be the last, a rarity in the pre-block era. The best course of action is for theme authors to leave core styles in place and extend them, even if it means some bloat for page loads. It is not a fool-proof plan, but it lightens the burden.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Overall, I welcome the Gallery block enhancement, even it breaks a few things. It potentially opens a world of possibilities and is necessary if the project ever wants to provide end-users with anything other than super basic functionality.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Tue, 23 Mar 2021 17:39:49 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:14:\"Justin Tadlock\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:30;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:49:\"WPTavern: Ulysses 22 Adds WordPress Post Updating\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:30:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=114118\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:143:\"https://wptavern.com/ulysses-22-adds-wordpress-post-updating?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=ulysses-22-adds-wordpress-post-updating\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:1429:\"<p><a href=\"https://ulysses.app/\">Ulysses</a>, the writing app for Mac, iPad and iPhone, released <a href=\"https://blog.ulysses.app/ulysses-22/\">version 22</a> this week with support for updating WordPress posts as the headline feature.

The announcement did not identify a specific reason for the formation of the new channel but briefly outlined its purpose as follows:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>It is primarily an opportunity for those who are contributing full-time to WordPress to gain valuable knowledge of how we lead with a global mindset and how WordPress applies open source methodologies in a broader context than software development.</p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Since the new channel is limited to full-time sponsored contributors, the enculturation process she described would exclude those who are not fortunate enough to be sponsored by a company. Traditionally, the WordPress community has worked towards transparency in decision-making as much as possible and in all aspects of development. This channel has the potential to create an imbalance between those with full-time status and those who can only volunteer part-time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;It can be difficult to&nbsp;<strong>not</strong>&nbsp;start making decisions wherever there is a discussion while working on WordPress,&rdquo; WordPress core contributor Jeremy Felt commented on the post. &ldquo;In some ways, every decision made in private can make it harder for future contributors who were not able to see the conversation. We are historically (core&nbsp;team, IMO) not good about documenting the&mdash;high bandwidth, in person&mdash;decisions that happen at WordCamps and other meetups. I think we can sometimes also be not so great at more permanently documenting decisions that are made in public chats.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Felt suggested WordPress consider making the channel read-only for non-participants or publish the chat log as a way to improve the documentation for private discussions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Joost de Valk requested the goal be more specific so participants can understand what falls within the scope of the private channel vs a discussion that should be public.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m honestly kind of radical about transparency and think there&rsquo;s too much secrecy already, but I also understand the need to be able to discuss without being interrupted,&rdquo; de Valk said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a hard balance. I wish&nbsp;Slack&nbsp;had the equivalent of &lsquo;voice&rsquo; of IRC, so we could make some of these types of channels public but not allow everyone to post in them.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The most critical feedback on the announcement came from WordPress Community Deputy Timi Wahalahti, who said he doesn&rsquo;t necessarily oppose the experiment but felt strongly that it was &ldquo;a bad call to start the experiment with just notification without any prior public discussion about it.&rdquo; He also said the explanation in the announcement doesn&rsquo;t adequately justify the need for the channel.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;Where was this proposed and discussed?&rdquo; Wahalahti said. &ldquo;To my knowledge, WordPress as a project lives from proposals, discussions and transparency. I&rsquo;m quite sure it&rsquo;s not the intention, but the project executive director making this kind of big decision that potentially impacts the transparency without transparent proposal and discussion looks like disparaging the project principles.&rdquo; </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Wahalahti asked what kind of discussion Haden Chomphosy envisions for the channel. He suggested that since these contributors already belong to multiple teams in the project, it might be &ldquo;more important to improve the conversational connection between sponsored and volunteer contributors,&rdquo; instead of focusing on strengthening the bond between full-time sponsored contributors.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The matter of hosting the experiment seems to be settled already but Haden Chomphosy is open to circling back to review the channel&rsquo;s efficacy after the next major release of WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;I will revisit the implementation post-WP5.8 to make sure it&rsquo;s useful, focused, avoiding black box decisions, and committing to transparency,&rdquo; Haden Chomphosy.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Mon, 22 Mar 2021 19:48:46 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:32;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:106:\"WPTavern: WebARX Rebrands To Patchstack, Combines Services To Focus on WordPress Plugin and Theme Security\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:30:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=113659\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:255:\"https://wptavern.com/webarx-rebrands-to-patchstack-combines-services-to-focus-on-wordpress-plugin-and-theme-security?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=webarx-rebrands-to-patchstack-combines-services-to-focus-on-wordpress-plugin-and-theme-security\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:5680:\"<p class=\"has-drop-cap\">In 2018, WebARX launched the first version of its security platform and grew to 3,000 users. Earlier this month, the company decided to <a href=\"https://patchstack.com/why-did-we-rebrand-from-webarx-to-patchstack/\">rebrand to Patchstack</a>. Outside of customers getting the name wrong, the company had grown beyond its original SaaS product, providing other services like PlugBounty, an open-source bug-hunting platform. Earlier this year, they also acquired ThreatPress, a WordPress security service provider. Combining the three created an opportunity to relaunch the brand.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://patchstack.com/\">Patchstack</a> is a website security company. Instead of focusing directly on the core WordPress software, it dives into the world of third-party extensions. For WordPress, that means monitoring and patching vulnerabilities in plugins, themes, and any other components users might install. The service&rsquo;s primary audience includes developers and digital agencies. It helps them to identify issues and provides almost real-time patching to eliminate threats.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Oliver Sild, Patchstack founder and CEO, already had the PlugBounty idea back in 2018. &ldquo;I realized it&rsquo;s impossible to tackle the security issues in the WordPress ecosystem if we don&rsquo;t have a big and strong community behind security as there is behind plugin/theme developers. I created a platform where security researchers can quickly put together a detailed security report for any WordPress plugin and which then will be delivered to the plugin developer.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The new <a href=\"https://patchstack.com/red-team/\">Patchstack Red Team</a> was what was previously the PlugBounty project. His company and other WordPress ecosystem members contribute to the &ldquo;prizepool,&rdquo; cash paid out monthly to the top security researchers based on scores from their contributions. All findings are also made publicly available for free through the <a href=\"https://patchstack.com/database/\">Patchstack Database</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;We manage the triage process by following a strict responsive disclosure policy and make sure the information reaches the right person and that the vulnerability will get properly fixed,&rdquo; said Sild.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Patchstack had already kept an internal database to compare customer software versions. After adding PlugBounty to the mix, it needed a public database to give credit to the community of security researchers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;We had discussions with different database vendors in the ecosystem, but the vision really clicked with ThreatPress,&rdquo; said Sild. &ldquo;The founder of ThreatPress also joined our team and is now running the Patchstack Database and Patchstack Red Team operations. Patchstack Database will be providing information about security vulnerabilities in the WordPress ecosystem and will remain free to use for the public. We also have API which hosting companies can use to notify their customers about vulnerabilities within the websites.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sild said that approximately 95% of security vulnerabilities in the WordPress ecosystem are from third-party code. &ldquo;The best thing you could do is making sure you have your websites updated,&rdquo; he said when asked about the low-hanging fruit that any site owner could take care of.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />Oliver Sild, Patchstack founder and CEO.\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;The second big issue is the pirated and nulled plugins &mdash; keep in mind that if you found a premium plugin/theme for free, then there is a reason behind this,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a trap many people fall into, and without their knowledge, they infect their own website with malware and backdoors. And how can I not mention passwords? Please use password management tools such as LastPass, KeePass, and try to enable two-factor authentication on all your accounts.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Free versions of commercial plugins and themes that are secure and up to date are possible to find. However, the average end-user would have no way of knowing if that was the case.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Patchstack is a SaaS product. Once users create an account through its system, it will guide them to connect their website with the Patchstack WordPress plugin.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;Once the website is connected, it sends environment details (plugin, theme, core, PHP, etc. versions) to Patchstack,&rdquo; said Sild. &ldquo;Patchstack then compares all the versions with known security issues and notifies the user if outdated/vulnerable code is detected.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Patchstack has different security modules, which can be enabled or disabled from the settings screen. One that is on by default is WordPress Virtual Patches. This feature detects if a vulnerable plugin is in use on the site and sends virtual patches immediately.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The service has a cloud-based dashboard, allowing users to access details for all of their sites in one place.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />Patchstack dashboard.\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;Patchstack allows you to create custom security alerts and send them on emails and Slack channels when vulnerable or outdated plugins are detected,&rdquo; said Sild. &ldquo;It provides a central overview on all the different security issues across an unlimited number of sites, and you can export a monthly PDF report for each website if needed. Additionally, to how many vulnerabilities and security issues you have on your websites &mdash; the Patchstack dashboard is also telling you when any of the vulnerable plugins/themes on your websites have been attacked, and you&rsquo;ll have granular details about each threat that has been blocked.&rdquo;</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Mon, 22 Mar 2021 18:36:18 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:14:\"Justin Tadlock\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:33;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:111:\"Gutenberg Times: Building Forms with Blocks, Work w/ Blocks via GraphQL API,  and more – Weekend Edition #163\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:35:\"https://gutenbergtimes.com/?p=17282\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:47:\"https://gutenbergtimes.com/weekend-edition-163/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:16804:\"<p>Howdy, </p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s another month, until we know if the Full-site editing experience is good enough for the merge into core.

In the post, she describes the tools and types of access the Themes Team needs. She also laid out some other goals for the system. The timeline is to have much of this in place by early 2022.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Two months ago, <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/upsells-barriers-and-the-end-beginning-of-the-quality-free-themes-era\">things were coming to a head</a>. Project lead Matt Mullenweg saw much of what we have all been seeing. Creative contributions to the free directory were few and far between, many of the submissions merely being stripped-down &ldquo;lite&rdquo; themes with commercial interests.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There was some disagreement on <em>why</em> the directory was not producing the high-quality projects users should expect from an official source. Mullenweg cited the rules and update mechanism as problem areas.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, others like Joost de Valk, the CPO of Yoast, said the reality of the situation is that money is now a part of the equation. Producing high-quality products, maintaining them, and supporting them is not sustainable without the financial resources in place. Because WordPress.org provides no path for developers to make money directly, upsell-motived themes are the result. Eric Karkovack expanded upon this in his piece for Speckyboy, <a href=\"https://speckyboy.com/are-high-quality-free-wordpress-themes-a-thing-of-the-past/\">Are High-Quality Free WordPress Themes a Thing of the Past?</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some of the Themes Team members disagreed that the rules were the problem. At the heart of the team&rsquo;s handbook is the idea that themes should be GPL-compatible, secure, and not break things.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The problem is not necessarily specific guidelines but the process. Mullenweg wanted to switch to a post-commit strategy that would see themes move into the directory more quickly. The goal is to be a little more like the plugin directory and let users guide others through the star-rating review system.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, themes and plugins are different beasts. Themes must follow some standard patterns and do some specific things to actually work. The best way to make that happen is with automated tools performing the grunt work that humans have been doing for the past decade. Many guidelines could become a line of code in a script. Each new line would lighten the burden on volunteers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Themes Team agreed with his assessment of the theme quality. However, some did feel like the theme system was the oft-forgotten stepchild who received all the hand-me-downs from its preferred sibling, the plugin directory. They needed resources from the community to drive any sort of change. Team members had little power outside of their gatekeeping responsibilities and were short on volunteers.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Changing Hearts and Minds</h2>\n\n\n\n<img />\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-drop-cap\">Haden Chomphosy <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/themes/2021/02/24/meeting-notes-matt-josepha-and-theme-review-team/\">published notes on the meeting</a> in February. The post detailed the ideas and what took place. However, much of it seemed vague in terms of actionable items. It was the groundwork phase.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In a private discussion with one of the Themes Team reps, they said the meeting was productive not because of action taking place but through the changing of outlooks. More of the team reps warmed to the idea of reducing the requirements and moving forward with a change. The meeting was more about winning hearts and minds, which was a necessary first step.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This changed outlook did not mean throwing caution to the wind and flipping the switch overnight. The team wanted to set some guardrails in place, particularly surrounding high-priority issues like proper licensing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;In the meeting, we discussed the need to change the review process,&rdquo; said team rep Ari Stathopoulos. &ldquo;All guidelines have a reason they exist. They were all added after some things got abused. But the process followed had an unfortunate side-effect; the rules that were added to avoid abuse by a few bad apples are the same rules that hinder innovation and deter people from submitting a theme in the repository.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He brought up the universal rules of not doing evil things, disrespecting others, or abusing the system. Citing them as the foundation of what the guidelines should be. &ldquo;But then, of course, everyone has a different definition of evil, disrespect, and abuse, so something a bit more verbose may be needed but obviously not as verbose as the dozens upon dozens of guidelines we currently have.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>The Next Steps: Tools and a User-First Strategy</h2>\n\n\n\n<img />\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-drop-cap\">The first goal is to have access to a functional meta environment for testing. One of the team reps currently has this. However, others would need access in the long term. Moderator tools are also on the list for reviewers, likely similar to what the Plugin Review Team has.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Those are some of the baseline things. The next item will be more automation. Dion Hulse is currently working on automated security checks, which should help with a consistent problem area. Steve Dufresne is working on an automated code-scanning solution.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One idea for a post-commit strategy is flagging themes with &ldquo;quality tags.&rdquo; These include items like Gutenberg-ready, security, last updated, translation-ready, and accessibility. It is not clear how this system would work, but it could be a way to surface themes in the directory that meet standards. <em>Perhaps a new featured-theme algorithm should be in the works?</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The last piece of the proposal introduces the concept of a yes/no voting mechanism for end-users. These would be &ldquo;trust tags&rdquo; that allowed users to mark themes as updated, visually broken, and more. The goal is to hand over much of the gatekeeping responsibility to users, putting them in the driver&rsquo;s seat of what they want out of the theme directory.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Fri, 19 Mar 2021 16:16:28 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:14:\"Justin Tadlock\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:35;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:127:\"WPTavern: Gutenberg 10.2 Adds Spacers To Navigation Lists, Lets Users Categorize Template Parts, and Introduces Scoped Patterns\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:30:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=113984\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:295:\"https://wptavern.com/gutenberg-10-2-adds-spacers-to-navigation-lists-lets-users-categorize-template-parts-and-introduces-scoped-patterns?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=gutenberg-10-2-adds-spacers-to-navigation-lists-lets-users-categorize-template-parts-and-introduces-scoped-patterns\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:6487:\"<p class=\"has-drop-cap\">Yesterday, version 10.2 of the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2021/03/17/whats-new-in-gutenberg-10-2-17-march/\">Gutenberg WordPress plugin landed</a>. Users can now add a Spacer block between Navigation items, categorize custom template parts, and pick between patterns when inserting the Query block.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The user experience continues to improve in some areas. The Media &amp; Text block, one of the few holdouts, can now be <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/29415\">transformed into Columns</a>. The transformation results in two columns with the media and the text separated. This is a one-way transform, however. It is a necessary enhancement for users who write out their text column to realize they can only add uploaded media instead of something like a YouTube embed to the Media &amp; Text block. Making a quick switch over to Columns solves the issue.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The &ldquo;Start writing or type / to choose a block&rdquo; prompt only <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/28275\">appears for the first empty paragraph</a> when there are subsequent paragraphs. It is a trivial change, but it removed a minor annoyance.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The development team squashed 30 bugs for Gutenberg 10.2. They also continued work toward improving experimental features such as the site editor, global styles, and block-based nav menus. Full Site Editing is shaping up, but it will still be a while before we know whether it will be ready for inclusion in WordPress 5.8.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As I write this post, I am also doing so in a broken editor.  Gutenberg 10.2, yet again, changed either its markup or CSS, which means I will have to do some digging to find out why all of our paragraphs are misaligned in the editor.  But, that is a job for tomorrow.  This should be a theme-specific fix and an isolated issue.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Nesting Spacer Blocks Within Navigation Lists</h2>\n\n\n\n<img />Inserting a Spacer into a Navigation list.\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-drop-cap\">In one of the worst ideas the Gutenberg project has brought us, users can now <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/29133\">insert spacer blocks</a> between horizontal Navigation block items. And they can increase or decrease the space in pixels. The idea of spacing is not in and of itself bad, but the solution used is.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As far as I know, the <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> tag is not allowed as a direct child of <code>&lt;ul&gt;</code>. That is where <code>&lt;li&gt;</code> elements go. Maybe it is my old-school HTML upbringing, but it does not feel right to throw other things in the mix. List items are the children of lists.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Fortunately, there are solutions for this sort of horizontal spacing that have been available to web designers for decades: margin and padding.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Spacer block has never felt right since it was introduced into Gutenberg. I always assumed it was an unfortunate stopgap solution for vertical spacing until we got proper margin and padding block options. I never imagined we would find new and inventive ways to use it for defiling a site&rsquo;s markup.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Template Part Categories</h2>\n\n\n\n<img />Selecting an area for a template part.\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-drop-cap\">Users can now <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/29159\">save template parts to a specific category</a> or &ldquo;area,&rdquo; as they are called in the site editor UI. In <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/gutenberg-10-1-enhances-reusable-blocks-updates-social-icons-spacing-options-and-normalizes-image-block-toolbar\">Gutenberg 10.1</a>, the development team introduced a new categorization system for theme authors that would automatically place template parts into the Header, Footer, Sidebar, or General categories. The same system is now open for user-created template parts.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When saving a template part via the site editor, users must open the &ldquo;Advanced&rdquo; block tab. There is a new &ldquo;Area&rdquo; option. The Sidebar category is missing in this release. Nevertheless, it is a welcome step toward template-part management.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Query Block Patterns</h2>\n\n\n\n<img />Pattern selections for the Query block in its initial state.\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-drop-cap\">The Query block is at the heart of Full Site Editing. It will eventually be one of the primary components both developers and users interact with as they build sites.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The development team introduced a new concept for end-users when first inserting the Query block. In the past, users saw several block variations. Now, they can <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/28891\">choose between patterns</a> that are specific to the block.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Out of the box, there are Large, Medium, and Small patterns. Users can also opt to start from a blank slate.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For developers, this change introduces scoped patterns. It is a new layer to the Block Patterns API that should offer a ton of flexibility in the long run. While the feature only works with the Query block right now, theme and plugin authors could create predefined layouts for blocks that users can choose from in the future.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Imagine having several different styles of post loops that you want to offer to your users. With a few lines of code, you could register each of these as selectable Query patterns.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The new part of the API adds a <code>scope</code> argument that looks like:</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>\'scope\' =&gt; [\n        \'inserter\' =&gt; false, // Whether to show in the main block inserter.\n        \'block\'    =&gt; [ \'core/query\' ] // The container block for the pattern.\n]</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>This is still in the experimental stage, so things could change as the feature is further developed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Following the core example, I created a quick Query pattern with the following code:</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>add_action( \'init\', function() {\n\n	register_block_pattern(\n		\'tavern-query\',\n		[\n			\'title\'  =&gt; \'Tavern Query\',\n			\'scope\'  =&gt; [\n				\'inserter\' =&gt; false,\n				\'block\'    =&gt; [ \'core/query\' ],\n			],\n			\'content\' =&gt;\n                \'&lt;!-- wp:post-title {\"isLink\":true} /--&gt;\n				&lt;!-- wp:post-featured-image {\"isLink\":true,\"align\":\"wide\"} /--&gt;\n				&lt;!-- wp:post-excerpt /--&gt;\n				&lt;!-- wp:separator --&gt;\n				&lt;hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"/&gt;\n				&lt;!-- /wp:separator --&gt;\n				&lt;!-- wp:post-date /--&gt;\'\n		]\n	);\n} );</code></pre>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Thu, 18 Mar 2021 22:45:55 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:14:\"Justin Tadlock\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:36;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:83:\"WPTavern: Elementor Patches XSS Vulnerabilities Affecting 7 Million WordPress Sites\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:30:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=113940\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:211:\"https://wptavern.com/elementor-patches-xss-vulnerabilities-affecting-7-million-wordpress-sites?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=elementor-patches-xss-vulnerabilities-affecting-7-million-wordpress-sites\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:3889:\"<p>Elementor users who haven&rsquo;t updated recently will want to get on the latest version 3.1.4 as soon as possible. Researchers at Wordfence disclosed&nbsp;a set of stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities in the plugin to its authors in February, which was partially patched at that time and additional fixes were released the second week of March. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Wordfence summarized the vulnerabilities in a <a href=\"https://www.wordfence.com/blog/2021/03/cross-site-scripting-vulnerabilities-in-elementor-impact-over-7-million-sites/\">post</a> published yesterday, accompanied by a detailed walkthrough of how an attacker might compromise sites using Elementor:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>These vulnerabilities allowed any user able to access the Elementor editor, including contributors, to add JavaScript to posts. This JavaScript would be executed if the post was viewed, edited, or previewed by any other site user, and could be used to take over a site if the victim was an administrator.</p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Many of the plugin&rsquo;s &ldquo;elements,&rdquo; or components, accept an <code>html_tag</code>&nbsp;parameter, which was output without escaping and could be set to execute a script. A few of the vulnerable elements include the column, accordion, heading, divider, icon box, and image box.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At the time of publishing, less than half of all Elementor installs are running on version 3.1.x, leaving millions of sites still vulnerable. Wordfence confirmed this morning that they are not currently seeing active exploits against these vulnerabilities.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><img /></div>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;Due to the privileges required, we expect it to be used primarily in targeted attacks rather than widespread attempts,&rdquo; Wordfence security researcher Ram Gall said.&nbsp;&ldquo;That is, it is likely to be used for privilege escalation once an attacker has been able to get a foot in the door, rather than a complete start-to-finish exploit chain. This is going to be more of a concern for sites that have many contributor or author users, as this means a wider attack surface. The main reason this is a concern is the sheer number of installations.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Gall, who discovered the vulnerabilities, described a scenario in which they are most easily exploited. A contributor on the site re-uses a password that has been in a data breach. The attacker finds that password, logs in, and adds a post with malicious code. The administrator sees the post from the contributor in the admin. Visiting that post will run the malicious JavaScript in the browser, which Gall said could infect the site with new rogue admin accounts or code to take over the site.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Apart from a brief mention in the changelog, Elementor did not alert its users to the security issues on the product&rsquo;s blog or social media accounts: </p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Fix: Hardened allowed options in the editor to enforce better security policies</li><li>Fix: Removed&nbsp;<code>html</code>&nbsp;option in Lightbox module to prevent security issues</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;Elementor was very responsive initially, though they didn&rsquo;t keep us updated about the patches after the initial report,&rdquo; Wordfence representative Kathy Zant said. &ldquo;They do have a security contact listed on their site, which is always helpful. Often, security researchers have a difficult time identifying and contacting the right person with whom to share vulnerability proof-of-concepts, so we&rsquo;re always grateful when we&rsquo;re able to easily start those discussions.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The latest version 3.1.4 contains the patches for these vulnerabilities, along with fixes for other less severe bugs in the plugin. Elementor users are advised to update as soon as possible to avoid the vulnerabilities being used for site takeover.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Thu, 18 Mar 2021 17:41:12 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:37;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:90:\"WPTavern: Work on the Twenty Twenty-Two Default WordPress Theme Should Already Be Underway\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:30:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=113906\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:225:\"https://wptavern.com/work-on-the-twenty-twenty-two-default-wordpress-theme-should-already-be-underway?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=work-on-the-twenty-twenty-two-default-wordpress-theme-should-already-be-underway\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:5806:\"<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>[The Eksell theme] does such a great job of selling a block editor-driven WordPress. It was a missed opportunity to not pair something of this quality with the block editor when WordPress 5.0 was released.</p><p>It&rsquo;s responsive! I&rsquo;m amazed this stands out as a highlight for me, but, as the official theme, Twenty Twenty-One breaks in pretty basic ways in multiple places for different screen widths. I think this visual approach is also probably more approachable as &ldquo;good design&rdquo; for the average person than Twenty Twenty-One&rsquo;s attempt at a more typographical approach&hellip;</p><cite>Daniel</cite></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-drop-cap\">In hindsight, it is easy to look back at past default themes and find fault. There is always something better around the corner. However, Daniel makes some good points <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/compatibility-is-not-enough-the-eksell-wordpress-theme-creates-art-with-blocks#comment-369254\">in his comment </a>on our recent <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/compatibility-is-not-enough-the-eksell-wordpress-theme-creates-art-with-blocks\">review of the Eksell theme</a>. The theme does sell the idea of blocks to the user far more so than many others.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It would be hard to convince me that launching a great block-ready theme with 5.0 would have been feasible, given that so much about the new block editor was changing at a lightning-quick pace. <em>But, a year or two later?</em> Probably.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Twenty Nineteen, which launched with WordPress 5.0 and its block editor, is the worst-rated (3.5 stars) default theme in history. Twenty Twenty was a decent block-ready outing. It also happened to be forked from Chaplin, a theme built by Eksell&rsquo;s designer, Anders Nor&eacute;n. While I still believe that Twenty Twenty-One was a refreshing shift and a fun experiment at the time, my fondness for it has waned in the last few months.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>None make a convincing case for the block editor. If we are being honest, there are not that many third-party themes in the official directory making it either.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I may have already said it thousand times, so once more will not hurt. Themes are the face of WordPress. They are often a new user&rsquo;s first introduction to our beloved platform and blogging in general. And, the default themes are the first they see.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The defaults also have another role they need to play today. They need to showcase blocks to all the old-timers among us who have clung to the classic editor and page builders we have used over the years.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is no doubt a tough job working on a default theme. We have world-class developers and designers putting in the hours to create something that needs to work on millions of websites. However, part of the toughness of the job is in the process.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Each of the last three default themes was announced in September or October of the year before a November &ndash; December release. While I am not privy to any private discussions or work that went on beforehand, the bulk of the theme-building and testing process has happened in a small window. WordPress has also forked at least the last two themes from existing projects, presumably because of the time constraints.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2021, the community should expect its fourth default theme, Twenty Twenty-Two, in the block era. It is time we begin thinking about what that should be instead of waiting until the 11th hour.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We are in mid-March. WordPress 5.9 is currently scheduled for December 2021, which should coincide with the Twenty Twenty-Two theme launch.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>By starting the research phase now, it gives us the head-start we lacked in years past. The development team would also not need to fork an existing theme. Forks are not necessarily bad, but starting early means the team can go down the from-scratch route if preferred. It is an opportunity to rethink the approach to default themes and do more community outreach before laying down the first code.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What are the trending features this year?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Which types of themes are most popular?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What has the community been asking for that we have yet to deliver?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Will this be the first block-based default theme to showcase Full Site Editing?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are tons of questions we should be asking, and more-seasoned designers are better suited to the task than I am.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Like Daniel said in the comments, we are not asking for Eksell to be ported to default-theme status. However, something with that design-quality level is what the community should expect. Make us believe; make us passionate; make us want to build our sites with it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>High-quality themes meant for public release are not built overnight. Except in the rarest cases, they are not created in a month. Client projects can often move faster because they are typically under controlled settings with fewer edge cases. Publicly-released themes do not have the same benefit because they need to handle everything users will throw at it and work alongside untold numbers of plugins. While all designers and developers have different processes and work at different paces, three months is easily the minimum amount of time to code and test a well-rounded theme for modern sites. Some of the best theme authors I know spend upwards to half a year fine-tuning their creations.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We need research, followed by a decision about what type of theme we are building. We need an outline of the goals it should achieve and its primary audience. Rounds of mockups before the code hits a repository. A real community effort.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Three months ago was the best time to begin planning for Twenty Twenty-Two. The second best time is today.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 17 Mar 2021 22:20:46 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:14:\"Justin Tadlock\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:38;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:80:\"Post Status: Chris Hardie on WP Lookout, WordPress updates and information flows\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"https://poststatus.com/?p=81771\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:90:\"https://poststatus.com/chris-hardie-on-wp-lookout-wordpress-updates-and-information-flows/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:2819:\"<p>Chris Hardie has been a web developer since the late 1990s.

As a partnership manager at YITH, I also had* the privilege of traveling worldwide and attended various WordCamps and WordPress events. I’ve co-organized WordCamps, Meetups, and with 28 WooCommerce London Meetups in 2020 alone.<br />\n<small>* We are still in a local lock down due to covid at the time of writing this.</small></p>\n<p>The rubbish part; Okay, nine years ago, life was not great, my daughter passed away, and I was stuck as a restaurant owner, working hard and not making much money, plus soon after, I started a court case against my landlord. Maybe this was the year I lost most of my hair, and it also caused my flare-up of UC… so hopefully, you get it, it was not a good time of my life, and I probably had every reason to find ‘the bottle’ more attractive.</p>\n<h3>From The Rubbish To The Good Part</h3>\n<p>When bad things happen to people, some will hide and go downhill, whereas others use this negative energy into something positive. I can’t say, I fall in either camp, but having been influenced by the right people around me, decisions I made, and by chance, I was being drawn towards the latter one.</p>\n<p>Soon after our daughter died, my wife, Nihan enrolled in the open university to finish her Computer Science degree. I have massive admiration for Nihan’s strong determination, and I wholeheartedly supported her in this decision. We managed to finance this with an adult learning grant and working as a chef in various local pubs.</p>\n<p>My wife’s coursework interested me a lot, and very soon, we started following the lectures together, plus extra course work I was practicing myself too.</p>\n<p>Then came the idea of affiliate commission earnings through blogging, which I started out using Joomla as a CMS platform. Creating websites was slowly becoming a passion for me, and in these first few years, I enjoyed every part of the steep learning curb tackling the basics to more advanced coding and designs.</p>\n<h3>Diving Into The Web</h3>\n<p>After reducing hours as a chef, I followed various online courses in coding and e-commerce, SEO, and online marketing. One of the training courses I signed up for was a lifetime deal for OSTraining. The lessons came in particularly useful when I applied for a job as a WordPress designer. Please note that at this time, I had heard of WordPress and used it as a blogging platform but not played with it as a designer. One of the tutors on OSTraining became my absolute savior in the next two weeks before my interview for a new WordPress job. His name is Topher, also well-known for being the founder of HeroPress.</p>\n<p>Having binge-watched various WP development topics and getting familiar with the structures, I was rather lucky to have been given the job. Still, this was only the beginning of my journey into the world of WordPress.</p>\n<p>A year later, my boss asked me whether I would consider taking over the business and clients. Together with my wife, we started a new brand and company that we then build up over the years. This path naturally leads us into a niche of working with WooCommerce in combination with Online marketing.</p>\n<blockquote><p>As I often say to people, WordPress is just one of the tools in my box, just like a carpenter can’t do without a hammer.</p></blockquote>\n<p>The skill in using it efficiently comes over time and even then, there are different techniques. We all look back at projects and think: “ouch, why did I do it that way?” I often hear the term ‘imposter syndrome.’ I don’t believe in this, as I think whoever progresses and explores is eager to learn and wants to improve. It is frankly in human nature to drive ourselves forward. WordPress has evolved in so many branches that require different skills, and thank goodness for that, or we’d all be in competition. Instead, there are 100’s of areas of expertise, roles, and jobs that complement WordPress to make it what it is. A big part of that is each person’s personal background complements their skillsets. Think about it, who you are and what you do is influenced by what you have done and learned. Cherishing this, adding your culture, language, and experience and you suddenly find yourself more than qualified. And often these are not skills or certificates you list on a CV as they might be good and also bad experiences.</p>\n<h3>Joining A Business</h3>\n<p>The next part of this chapter was my dealings with YITH. As a long-term customer and having met some of the team at WordCamp London, I got into discussions to represent them at events held in the UK. This soon went global with me attending WordCamps in 3 other countries… and this was the moment I realized I could do much more with my connections and create meaningful partnerships. Within a few weeks, I crafted my dream job and sent a proposal to Nando, the CEO of YITH.</p>\n<blockquote><p>It is not easy to pitch yourself with an idea hoping that someone, I never met or spoken, understands this vision.</p></blockquote>\n<p>The doubts went through my head; “do I give up my business and work for the benefit of another company? What if I don’t get on? After all, I met 2 out of a team of 40 only three years ago… What do I do with my customers? Thinking of which, they have been demanding and not paying us on time. Plus, they annoy me when I want to be on holiday, not just that, they cause arguments between my wife and me. Because what is more important, family time or a site down and a business that is not earning enough money? Okay, this could work out, and I will try it for a year; if not, I can pick up my business again while my wife continues running it.” That was my thought process every day for months…</p>\n<p>Then we agreed, and I was not sure if I should be happy or not. A year later, I can only say that working for Nando at YITH has been the best choice. He has been my mentor, supporter, devil’s advocate, and friend, but not a ‘boss.’ He has never told me what to do, but instead, asked questions to make me realize what is achievable, or even better, simply suggests me to read a book and come to my conclusions. YITH is an organization without hierarchy based on a holacratic structure.</p>\n<a href=\"https://s20094.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/DSC5927-scaled.jpg\"><img /></a>The Yith Team\n<h3>Looking Back</h3>\n<p>I often think back to the moment my daughter passed away. She only lived for a few days, but ask any bereaved parent; it is often the thought of: ‘what could have been.’ It will have been nine years, and every day, I wonder how events would have unfolded if she had survived. So, maybe her memory lives on in every decision I make and the paths I decide to take. But did I make the right decisions? I would have said yes, though only last week, my wife suggested she never really processed the events nine years ago. The path ahead will not always be straight, but whatever the next turning is, I hope I can nudge it in the right direction. After all, I have big and exciting plans ahead!</p>\n<p>Is this story helpful to someone? Maybe it is for one of two reasons.</p>\n<blockquote><p>If you struggle to change your career, you can do this, though it might take a couple of years of a transitional period.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Only looking back do I realize that each small step slowly made a difference in my life. I am no guru or dare-devil entrepreneur that will tell you how to do things. No, I am an ordinary person with dreams and aspirations, just like there are so many in the world. But as I write this, it was WordPress that made this world smaller and empowered me to make a change. Learning from someone on the other side of the world and even getting work and customers from companies and people I never met before. Feeling welcomed into the WordPress community through Meetups and WordCamps added this human dimension and confidence that I can do ‘this’ too.</p>\n<p>For those who had a personal tragedy, I hope that I can give you hope and strength to try and put your energy into something else that can lead to more significant changes in your life. Our minds are mighty and the tiny small decisions of: ‘if I do this then that, and if this then that’ &#8211; you see life is like a game of chess and you can influence the outcome a lot… I accept, not always, but take it as one positive decision at a time.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://s20094.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/PXL_20200912_144823691.MP_-scaled.jpg\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://heropress.com/essays/empowered-to-make-a-change/\">Empowered To Make A Change</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://heropress.com\">HeroPress</a>.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 17 Mar 2021 08:13:19 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Ronald Gijsel\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:41;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:85:\"WPTavern: Automatically Create Image Slideshows With the Full Screen Galleries Plugin\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:30:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=113770\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:215:\"https://wptavern.com/automatically-create-image-slideshows-with-the-full-screen-galleries-plugin?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=automatically-create-image-slideshows-with-the-full-screen-galleries-plugin\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:2946:\"<p class=\"has-drop-cap\">Earlier today, core WordPress contributor Nick Halsey released <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/full-screen-galleries/\">Full Screen Galleries</a>, a plugin that automatically creates a full-screen slideshow when site visitors click on an image. The plugin works with all images, regardless of whether they are in a gallery block. It also supports both the classic and block editors.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Lightbox-type plugins are a dime a dozen. It is tough to wade through them to find the perfect solution. However, sometimes the simplest solution is the way to go. Halsey&rsquo;s plugin has no settings screen, post metadata, or block options. It is plug-and-play.  The only configuration is in activating the plugin itself.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Full Screen Galleries creates a slideshow-style overlay for all images located on a post or page. When a visitor clicks on one, the full-screen slideshow takes over the page.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />Slideshow overlay from Full Screen Galleries.\n\n\n\n<p>Halsey has a <a href=\"https://celloexpressions.com/photography/2020/02/raindance-ranch-winter-2020/\">demo page on his site</a> where potential users can see the plugin in action.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are more advanced options out there. Some show EXIF data, create transition effects and other types of animation, and offer a boatload of customizable settings. However, I prefer the simplicity of something that I can activate and forget. Over the years, I have come to appreciate these types of plugins more and more. They let me get back to focusing on the parts of my sites that I care about.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Full Screen Galleries also figures out the full-sized image URL automatically. If a gallery uses thumbnail-sized images and links to the attachment page, the slideshow will still display it in full.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Each slide outputs forward and back arrows to scroll between the images. In the top left corner is an exit button. In the top right, the plugin outputs a northeast arrow button that links to the original image. It also displays the image caption if it is available.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For many users, this is all they need. I am particularly interested in it because it works well with classic content. Many of the sites I am involved with have years of galleries from the pre-block era.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the downsides is that the plugin relies on jQuery. The plugin&rsquo;s code has a small footprint, but jQuery has grown into a bit of a beast over the years and is becoming less and less relevant with more recent features of modern JavaScript. For many WordPress sites, this may be a non-issue because their theme or some other plugin is already loading the jQuery library. This plugin will be a lightweight addition. For others who are keeping it lean, they might want to seek out alternative solutions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Regardless, this plugin is going into my toolbox, ready to pull out when I need it. Overall, it is a dependable version 1.0.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Tue, 16 Mar 2021 22:41:03 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:14:\"Justin Tadlock\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:42;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:45:\"BuddyPress: BuddyPress 7.2.1 Security Release\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:32:\"https://buddypress.org/?p=317662\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:65:\"https://buddypress.org/2021/03/buddypress-7-2-1-security-release/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:2581:\"<p><a href=\"https://downloads.wordpress.org/plugin/buddypress.7.2.1.zip\">BuddyPress 7.2.1</a> is now available.

Attackers have also been installing malicious plugins called &ldquo;WP Strongs&rdquo; and &ldquo;WP Staff.&rdquo; Those who cannot access the admin dashboard will have a more difficult time removing these plugins. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Elementor users who have the Plus Addons plugin installed are advised to update to the latest version and check for malicious plugins and files. Ideally, site owners who were subject to exploits would have a backup to restore.  Chamberland concluded the Wordfence Live broadcast today by walking users through manually cleaning up exploited sites, including replacing the wp-includes and wp-admin folders, along with standard files outside those directories.

The law requires the companies to negotiate licensing agreements with publishers in order to include news articles in both search and news feeds, including snippets.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Last month, Microsoft published its <a href=\"https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2021/02/11/endorsement-australias-proposal-technology-news/\">endorsement</a> of the Australian proposal and stated intentions for its Bing search engine to comply. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;In the hunt for better ideas, Google&rsquo;s threat to boycott an entire country got our attention,&rdquo; Microsoft President Brad Smith said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;Satya Nadella and I reached out to Prime Minister Morrison. It was an opportunity to combine good business with a good cause and, as we explained, even if Google wanted to leave Australia, we would stay.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>After negotiations, Facebook decided to simply block Australian publishers from posting and block users from sharing any news originating from the country. In a full reversal, the company <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-news-corp-facebook/news-corp-reaches-deal-with-facebook-in-australia-idUSKBN2B72Q9\">inked a three-year agreement with News Corp</a> today, which covers The Australian national newspaper and several metropolitan papers. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Similarly, Google did not make good on its threat to remove its search engine from Australia, reluctantly making deals with Australian publishers and News Corp a few weeks ago. The company&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://blog.google/products/news/google-commitment-supporting-journalism/\">statement</a> on Friday characterizes Microsoft&rsquo;s position and its overt contrasting with Google, as &ldquo;naked corporate opportunism&rdquo; and an attack:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>We also believe that this important debate should be about the substance of the issue, and not derailed by naked corporate opportunism &hellip; which brings us to Microsoft&rsquo;s sudden interest in this discussion. We respect Microsoft&rsquo;s success and we compete hard with them in cloud computing, search,&nbsp;productivity apps, video conferencing, email and many other areas. Unfortunately, as competition in these areas intensifies, they are reverting to their familiar playbook of attacking rivals and lobbying for regulations that benefit their own interests. They are now making self-serving claims and are even willing to break the way the open web works in an effort to undercut a rival. And their claims about our business and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://blog.google/supportingnews#facts\">how we work with news publishers</a>&nbsp;are just plain wrong.</p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>The historic rivalry has been reignited, as Google fired back at Microsoft&rsquo;s insinuation that the company doesn&rsquo;t support journalism and is unwilling to collaborate with publishers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;Proposals that would disrupt access to the open web (such as requiring payment for just showing links to websites) would hurt consumers, small businesses, and publishers,&rdquo; Google&rsquo;s SVP of Global Affairs Kent Walker said. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s why we&rsquo;ve engaged constructively with publishers around the world on better solutions and will continue to do so.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Microsoft supports Australia&rsquo;s new law as a means to rectify &ldquo;competitive imbalance between the tech sector and an independent press.&rdquo; It also gives the company a high perch from which to call out Google and Facebook as &ldquo;profitable tech gatekeepers on which businesses must advertise to reach consumers.&rdquo; Microsoft believes its endorsement spurred Google to reverse its decision in order to remain in competition for the Australian search market.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;Unlike Google, if we can grow, we are prepared to sign up for the new law&rsquo;s obligations, including sharing revenue as proposed with news organizations,&rdquo; Brad Smith said. &ldquo;The key would be to create a more competitive market, something the government can facilitate. But, as we made clear, we are comfortable running a high-quality search service at lower economic margins than Google and with more economic returns for the press.&rdquo;</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Tue, 16 Mar 2021 03:13:47 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:45;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:89:\"WPTavern: Compatibility Is Not Enough: The Eksell WordPress Theme Creates Art With Blocks\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:30:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=113779\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:221:\"https://wptavern.com/compatibility-is-not-enough-the-eksell-wordpress-theme-creates-art-with-blocks?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=compatibility-is-not-enough-the-eksell-wordpress-theme-creates-art-with-blocks\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:6218:\"<img />\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-drop-cap\">It is easy to become jaded after reading the same old keyword-stuffed theme descriptions. After viewing the same hero-plus-three-boxes theme designs. After seeing another theme with &ldquo;block editor styles&rdquo; that utterly fails to deliver on its promise.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As I peruse <a href=\"https://andersnoren.se/themes/eksell/\">the demo</a> of Anders Nor&eacute;n&rsquo;s latest WordPress theme, <a href=\"https://www.andersnoren.se/teman/eksell-wordpress-theme/\">Eksell</a>, I am reminded that artists still exist in the WordPress theming realm. For those familiar with his past theming work, this is not revelatory. Most of his 20+ free themes have 1,000s of active installations &mdash; <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/first-look-at-twenty-twenty-new-wordpress-default-theme-based-on-chaplain\">Chaplin even became the base of the Twenty Twenty</a> default theme.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><img />Single post view.</div>\n\n\n\n<p>Awaiting a theme from Nor&eacute;n is almost like counting down the days until your favorite director&rsquo;s film hits the theater. You know you are going to like it before you see it. Even the worse outing is better than everything else spilling through the pipeline. Every now and then, you are greeted with something special.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I could not wait this time. Nor&eacute;n&rsquo;s latest project is at a pitstop in the review system, so it is not <em>officially</em> available in the WordPress theme directory yet. In the meantime, anyone can still grab a ZIP file from its <a href=\"https://themes.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/96348\">Trac ticket</a> and upload it the old-fashioned way.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Eksell is a love letter to the block editor.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is more than just making a few style adjustments to work around any quirks of the default block styles. It is an extension of those styles to create something unique. It is more than running a theme through a few tests and calling it <em>compatible</em>. It is looking at common problems and making sure they are styled correctly on the front end. And it is more than slapping a few blocks together and calling them a pattern. It is about providing users with a one-click solution for custom-designed or tough-to-build elements.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Building WordPress themes means being able to wrangle tons of elements that users can rearrange on a whim. The block editor has increased those pieces at least tenfold. It is rare to see a theme that manages to handle every edge case, and I am sure there are some that Eksell misses. However, the whole of the work is one of &mdash; if not the best &mdash; block-ready themes available today.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If there is one area in which Eksell did not go far enough, it is with block patterns. The theme registers five of them:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Cover Header</li><li>Featured Items</li><li>Call to Action</li><li>Contact Details</li><li>Stacked Full Groups</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<img />Cover Header block pattern.\n\n\n\n<p>Each of these is in the demo. However, there are some missed opportunities, such as the following three-column &ldquo;pattern&rdquo;:</p>\n\n\n\n<img />Three columns with images on the outside and text on the inside.\n\n\n\n<p>Pros at building layouts with blocks could recreate that in minutes. A one-click option for inserting it into a post might save a headache or two for average users.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is not the only example. Eksell&rsquo;s demo is full of experimental groupings that showcase the flexibility of the block system. As bold as it is, the theme is a bit timid with its patterns. There is no need to be. They are already there. They simply need to be registered in the system.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Users can stack individual Image and Gallery blocks, making them appear as part of the same gallery. The theme automatically adjusts the margins between the blocks, bringing them together.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />Gallery + Image + Gallery block stacked.\n\n\n\n<p><em>Another candidate for a block pattern.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>And, here&rsquo;s the thing. I firmly believe the traditional theming paradigm held back this theme. Its uniqueness is in its handling of blocks, which are still limited to the content area in WordPress. When the site editor and global styles land in WordPress later this year, a theme like this would already be miles ahead of others in integrating with Full Site Editing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Eksell is more than just a theme that <em>does cool stuff with the block editor</em>. It is a genuinely useful portfolio theme. Instead of marketing it as yet another <s>multipurpose</s> general-purpose project, it has a target audience. Despite that, it is well-rounded enough to handle a variety of situations. Nor&eacute;n made sure the theme would work for blogging with on-point typography.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>By default, the theme displays blog posts in a grid-style portfolio. However, Jetpack users can opt to use the plugin&rsquo;s portfolio project post type to keep their portfolio separate from their blog.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One feature that might go overlooked is that Eksell provides an option to upload a fallback featured image. Far too often, portfolio-style themes with post-image grids fail to load a default image. The expectation is that the user will have featured images for every post, which is not always the case. When a theme is built around this idea, it needs to cover all of its bases, covering edge cases where things might fall apart. Eksell handles this, but Nor&eacute;n is an old pro at this point. He doubtless knows these common pitfalls.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The theme does not overwhelm users with options. It provides enough flexibility to personalize the theme&rsquo;s color scheme and make a few layout-related decisions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Old-school theme options will be a thing from a past era in the coming years. It is best to focus on the elements users will be working with for the long term. The customization power is with what users decide to do with blocks, and Eksell is ready for whatever users might throw at it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Every WordPress theme author should dive into the Eksell theme. Consider it a free masterclass in building on top of the block editor. It is the standard by which we should be judging all other offerings.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Mon, 15 Mar 2021 22:54:38

When it’s released, you get to choose what happens. You can install the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/classic-editor/\">Classic Editor plugin</a> today and when 5.0 is released, nothing will change. We’ve commited to supporting and updating Classic Editor until 2022. If you’d like to <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/gutenberg/\">install Gutenberg early</a>, you can do that now too. The Classic Editor plugin has been available for 13 months now, and Gutenberg has been available for 18 months. Both have been heavily promoted since August 2018, and more than 1.3 million .org sites have opted-in already to either experience, so nothing will change for them when they update to 5.0.</p> </div> <div class=\"schema-faq-section\" id=\"faq-question-1543929747530\"><strong class=\"schema-faq-question\">Is it terrible to do a release in December?</strong> <p class=\"schema-faq-answer\">Some people think so, some don’t. There have been <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/about/roadmap/\">9 major WordPress releases</a> in previous Decembers. December releases actually comprise 34% of our major releases in the past decade.</p> </div> <div class=\"schema-faq-section\" id=\"faq-question-1543932662856\"><strong class=\"schema-faq-question\">What if I don’t want to update on that date, or I’m not ready?</strong> <p class=\"schema-faq-answer\">That’s totally okay, there’s nothing that says you must update the moment there’s a new version released. You can push the button whenever you’re ready.</p> </div> <div class=\"schema-faq-section\" id=\"faq-question-1543932734088\"><strong class=\"schema-faq-question\">What if I want to upgrade but I’m not ready for Gutenberg?</strong> <p class=\"schema-faq-answer\">No problem, <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/classic-editor/\">install the Classic Editor plugin</a> and 5.0 will be indistinguishable from 4.9.8 for your posting and editing experience, and you’ll still get the other improvements and fixes that have gone into 5.0. Classic Editor is supported until 2022, and now allows you to switch between Classic and Gutenberg on a per-user or per-post level.</p> </div> </div>\n\n\n\n<p><em>November 30, 2018. </em><a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2018/11/29/5-0-gutenberg-status-update-nov-29/\">WordPress 5.0 RC2&nbsp;</a> is scheduled for&nbsp; today.

Blythe, <a href=\"https://allmyfriendsarejpegs.com\">allmyfriendsarejpegs.com</a></p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Transcript: Matt Mullenweg&#8217;s Keynote at WordCamp Europe (Excerpt)<br /></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>(&#8230;) The major features that are in effect so far are we have a block based writing experience, with over 20 blocks built in. Gutenberg is fully adaptive, meaning that whether you&#8217;re looking at it on a small screen, a medium screen, a large screen, a huge screen, the design and the functionality adapts to be fluid and easy to use on any of those.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There is ah, there we go &#8230; Optimized for direct manipulation of content, so we&#8217;re bringing it closer to where what you&#8217;re editing looks a lot more like what you&#8217;re seeing on the front page. They have a block aid [inaudible 00:00:43], support for static and dynamic blocks.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Matt&#8217;s Favorite Gutenberg Feature: Copy/Paste API</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>This is one of my favorite, the universal API, which is copy and paste. Who&#8217;s ever tried to copy and paste things into the WordPress editor, or anyplace else, and it just goes kind of sideways?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Gutenberg already has support for fully supported copy and paste from Google Docs, a Apple&#8217;s Pages, everyone&#8217;s favorite Microsoft Word, Office 365, Evernote, Legacy WordPress, random webpages, and then finally something that I know will be very popular with this audience is Markdown.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That&#8217;s actually what you are seeing in this little GIF there, is a copy and paste from a Markdown source. That&#8217;s a note editor or for wherever you want. You paste into Gutenberg, it translates it just instantly into Gutenberg blocks. It&#8217;s very, very slick. If you haven&#8217;t tried this yet, I&#8217;d highly recommend trying it. It&#8217;s one of my favorite hidden features alongside &#8230; I&#8217;ll tell you about my other favorite hidden feature. Which is that when you copy and paste the URL onto some text, it auto links it. Saves a ton of time.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Templates, Shared Blocks, Nested Blocks and Child Blocks</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>There are templates for predefined blocks. This is starting to go into where you can see hints of where we are going to end up, with full site customization with this. Which basically allows you to create for your users or for yourself kind of pre-built layouts where you can say, &#8220;Okay. A title goes here, an image goes here, some text goes here, a map goes here.&#8221; That can be reused over and over again, or assigned to entire pages. There&#8217;s shared blogs, so if you do want to reuse things across the entire site, that can be a shared unified resource. So when you edit it once, it shows up everywhere.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And finally, we are very excited about, that we have nested blocks and child blocks. These are blocks within blocks. Like it&#8217;s turtles and blocks all the way down, and child blocks, which only work if the parent block is there. Perhaps like your children. Media drag and drop. Extensions where you can add extra things to the sidebar. Like this beautiful &#8220;Hello Belgrade&#8221; extension here.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>30 Gutenberg releases, 1,700 issues open , 1,100 closed</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>There have been 30 Gutenberg releases, since we started, and 12 just since WordCamp US in December. As you can see, this is kind of running through all the different releases. There have been over 1,700 issues opened, and 1,100 closed in the Gutenberg Project thus far. From the development point of view, I&#8217;m very proud of it. We have open development, design-led testing in our releases, presentations across pretty much every WordCamp now, including here. It&#8217;s developed a wide awareness. Support and awareness in every single page builder out there. You know the names.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We already have people who&#8217;ve extended Gutenberg through plugins they are starting to pick up in the directory, and major sites. Agencies and others have been building and launching things with Gutenberg because, to be honest, it works. It&#8217;s not perfect yet. We&#8217;re not ready to release it yet, but for the things it does, it does them well. You can actually start using this in production already.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are now 14,000 sites actively using Gutenberg. So this isn&#8217;t just installed it&#8217;s actually active. Just released this week are tools for enterprises. This one called <a href=\"https://vip.wordpress.com/2018/06/13/jumpstart-gutenberg-testing-transition-ramp/\">Gutenberg Ramp</a>, which is a new plugin from VIP which basically allows them to turn Gutenberg on for certain post ID&#8217;s, page ID&#8217;s or content text. So that way you can start to phase in. Say you have a really complex setup of WordPress and maybe certain post types of things, extra customization. You can start to turn Gutenberg on for parts of it, not for others until you get to the point where you have everything on and fully done.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But the question I&#8217;m going to preempt it, so you don&#8217;t need to ask it is &#8220;What&#8217;s coming next in the world of Gutenbergification?&#8221; Which is just kinda fun to say. It sounds almost like a German word right?</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Roadmap For Gutenberg Roll-Out</h3>\n\n\n\n<h4>Happening in June</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Here&#8217;s the roadmap. So these are things happening in June which means they are highly .. [inaudible] . First I&#8217;m going to freeze new features coming in to Gutenberg. We&#8217;ve reached a point where there is a functionality that matches in affect of in the area it exceeds what we accomplished in the editor. We&#8217;re gonna encourage host agencies and teachers to start opting in folks that they have influence over to start using Gutenberg. Now very much &#8230; especially if it&#8217;s someone who you&#8217;re working with close to so that you can start to gather feedback from third party users of it, people who are involved in development everyday and pass that back, of course, to developers. This is to compliment the user testing, since the user testing that we&#8217;ve already been doing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the hosts that&#8217;s gonna be sort of contributing to this is WordPress.com so there is several hundred thousand, in the high numbers of thousands folks from WordPress.com that actually use wp-admin interface primarily. So we&#8217;re gonna be offering a call to action to opt-in. You can start using it very soon. One of the key measures that we are tracking there are the number of sites and the number of posts that are using this.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Then finally the mobile apps, which I said are getting more and more popular. Right now, if you move between editing things in the mobile apps, Gutenberg, it breaks in pretty spectacular fashion. So within the next few weeks that will be all fixed up across both IOS and Android. </p>\n\n\n\n<h4>Coming up in July: Thousands more users .org and .com<br /></h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Coming up in July, there is going to be a 4.9 point WordPress release that has a <a href=\"https://gutenbergtimes.com/try-out-gutenberg-call-out-will-be-in-4-9-5-release/\">strong invitation in the dashboard.</a> The first time we&#8217;ve had this, to either install Gutenberg or the Classic Editor Plugin. So basically we will be encouraging people to get on the train early, or if when 5.0 comes out and your site is not gonna be ready for it, <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/classic-editor/\">install the Classic Editor Plugin</a>. For those who don&#8217;t know, basically locks in your site to use how WordPress WYSIWYG editor&nbsp; works today. So it kinda opts you out of Gutenberg. We&#8217;re, of course, going to be tracking the use of both those.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We&#8217;re gonna switch to opt-in for their wp-admin on dot com to be opt-out and I&#8217;m tracking who opts out and trying to gather as much data from them as well because there&#8217;s gonna be a lot of information there, especially from people who might be using third party plugins on WordPress.com. Be a heavy, heavy triage on bug gardening, getting all the blockers to zero. Then finally, we&#8217;re gonna actually kick off and maybe even branch off the customization leads to start the work for what we wanna launch hopefully this year. Which is more of the full site editing experience of Gutenberg.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4>In August and Beyond: Merge Proposal<br /></h4>\n\n\n\n<p>So in August and beyond we&#8217;ll have all critical issues resolved. It&#8217;ll be integrated with the Calypso interface on WordPress.com, which is where the majority of people use it. I want to have 100,000 sites, 250,000 posts made, so 100,000 sites active with Gutenberg over 10x, where it is today, about 10x where it is today. A quarter million posts I think we&#8217;ll be able to say that a lot of the bugs will be worked out. We&#8217;re gonna merge with Core beginning the 5.0 release cycle. So beta releases, translations and then finally we are planning &#8230; there&#8217;s work undergoing, it&#8217;s not ready yet, but there will be full mobile versions of Gutenberg at the end of the year in the iOS and Android app.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>By August, they won&#8217;t break when you move between them. Of course, Gutenberg is done in a way that makes the content and the Markup backwards compatible. We&#8217;re actually gonna have the blocks supported in the mobile apps so that as you drag and drop blocks, move them around, have different sort of fun things you can do, that&#8217;ll all be there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We could have a 5.0 as soon as August. Some of these things that I put up there, I&#8217;m very, very sure about. The big thing that we&#8217;re not sure about is as we vastly increase the average usage of Gutenberg across hopefully 100,000 sites. &#8220;What&#8217;s gonna come in?&#8221; </p>\n\n\n\n<h4>Not date promised, though. </h4>\n\n\n\n<p>The non-deterministic nature of fixing bugs means that I don&#8217;t know exactly the issues that could raise. Whether they&#8217;re going to be small tweaks or rather they might be sort of huge things that are going to require a few weeks of development. That is why I can&#8217;t promise you a date but we&#8217;ve done a lot of testing this far so the nature of bugs that we find &#8230; there&#8217;s no black swans in there of bugs. I do think that 5.0 is gonna be ready within a relatively short time frame.&nbsp; And that&#8217;s all I got so thank you very much.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Sun, 14 Mar 2021 22:30:07 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:18:\"Birgit Pauli-Haack\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:47;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:109:\"Gutenberg Times: Full-Site Editing Testing, Merge Timeline, and Plugins for Block Editor Weekend Edition #162\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:35:\"https://gutenbergtimes.com/?p=17216\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:53:\"https://gutenbergtimes.com/full-site-editing-testing/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:18059:\"<p>Howdy, </p>\n\n\n\n<p>With the WordPress 5.7 out of the way, the next couple of month are all about Full-site Editing testing and planing for 5.8. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I love it when a plan comes together!

WordPress&rsquo; official block directory <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/call-for-block-plugins-the-wordpress-block-directory-is-open-for-business\">launched in June 2020</a> with just 60 single-block plugins. Today, it has grown to more than <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/browse/blocks/\">480 blocks</a>. As users incorporate more blocks into their websites, the block inserter can become a very long list to scroll when browsing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Block management capabilities were added to Gutenberg in <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/gutenberg-5-3-introduces-block-management-adds-nesting-to-the-cover-block\">version 5.3</a>, released in 2019. It allows users to search for a block and turn individual blocks and sections on or off in the block inserter. The feature hasn&rsquo;t changed much over the past two years but will soon be getting a major update that will relocate it to the Preferences modal and redesign it to use panels with support for&nbsp;<a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/27708\">toggling block variations</a>&nbsp;on and off.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you need more fine-grained block management, <a href=\"https://connekthq.com/\">Darren Cooney</a>&lsquo;s <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/block-manager/\">Gutenberg Block Manager</a> plugin offers an admin interface for removing and recategorizing blocks. It is different from the core capabilities in that site admins can globally manage the enabled/disabled state of each block and changes will be reflected in the block inserter for all users. The plugin provides a full-screen interface for managing blocks on its own settings page outside of the editor.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><img /></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Each block has a description and a toggle button for disabling it. There is enough space to include the number of instances for each block, and this seems like something useful the plugin could add in the future. Block categories are available as a quick navigation list in the sidebar and entire categories can be turned on or off with one click. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The latest version of the plugin adds Category Switcher support for all blocks, including core Gutenberg blocks. Changing a block&rsquo;s category will update its location in the block inserter.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><img /></div>\n\n\n\n<p>This plugin could be useful for periodically tidying up, improving the organization of&nbsp;blocks&nbsp;within the&nbsp;block&nbsp;inserter. Paring back the list of available blocks could also make it easier for website managers to have access to only the blocks that are necessary for their work. The plugin includes a filter for controlling the status of blocks across multiple WordPress environments.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>After testing the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/block-manager/\">Gutenberg Block Manager</a>, my only criticism is that the plugin&rsquo;s name is the same as the core WordPress feature, making it somewhat confusing. It might be more clear to focus on its distinctions and include that in the name, such as &ldquo;Global Block Manager&rdquo; or some variation. Other than that, it functions just as advertised and is available for free in the official plugins directory.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Sat, 13 Mar 2021 03:14:39 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:49;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:64:\"WPTavern: 2nd Annual Atarim Web Agency Summit Kicks Off March 23\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:30:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=113661\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:173:\"https://wptavern.com/2nd-annual-atarim-web-agency-summit-kicks-off-march-23?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=2nd-annual-atarim-web-agency-summit-kicks-off-march-23\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:6118:\"<p class=\"has-drop-cap\">Atarim is launching its 2nd annual <a href=\"https://atarim.io/summit/\">Web Agency Summit</a> in a couple of weeks. The free event will run from March 23 &ndash; 26. The goal of the event is to help agencies and freelancers in the WordPress space grow sustainable businesses.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Atarim is the company formerly known as WP Feedback. In February, the <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/wp-feedback-rebrands-to-atarim-moves-to-a-full-saas-model\">business rebranded</a> because its primary product had grown beyond a mere feedback plugin into an across-the-board agency solution.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;While I&rsquo;m a big fan of WordCamps and a big believer in the value that events can bring to personal growth, we found that most events in our space focus on the technical aspect of building a website,&rdquo; said Vito Peleg, Atarim&rsquo;s founder. &ldquo;We take a more business-oriented approach. From finding the first clients through building solid recurring revenue and all the way to lessons from some of the biggest agencies in the world at full scale.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The event has 36 sessions, which are broken down into four categories that focus on:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Build:</strong> Best practices for performance, SEO, accessibility, and the future of building websites.</li><li><strong>Expand:</strong> Building recurring revenue and maintaining profits.</li><li><strong>Scale:</strong> Project management, completing services, payment, and getting projects unstuck.</li><li><strong>Thrive:</strong> Hiring, community building, profitability at scale, and exit strategies.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Peleg hopes that attendees can glean some knowledge in the sessions while saving years of trial and error.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;All are delivered through our own summit platform, so attendees don&rsquo;t need to jump around between Zoom calls, YouTube Lives, and Slack channels,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;We brought it all into our own interactive platform.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Atarim has made several sessions publicly available from <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/wp-feedback-kicks-off-free-virtual-summit-for-wordpress-professionals-on-april-27\">2020&rsquo;s event</a>. For those on the fence, it should provide insight into the types of talks they can expect.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Lee Jackson</strong>: <a href=\"https://atarim.io/summit/mastering-content-creation-with-lee-jackson/\">Mastering Content Creation and the New Work Environment</a></li><li><strong>Clifford Almeida:</strong> <a href=\"https://atarim.io/summit/six-figure-recurring-revenue-business-with-clifford-almeida/\">Blueprint To Building a Six-Figure Recurring Revenue Business</a></li><li><strong>Alex Panagis:</strong> <a href=\"https://atarim.io/summit/simple-seo-strategy-with-alex-panagis/\">Developing a Simple and Replicable SEO Strategy for Your Business</a></li><li><strong>Alison Rothwell:</strong> <a href=\"https://atarim.io/summit/profitable-wordpress-care-plans-with-alison-rothwell/\">The Path To Selling Profitable WordPress Care Plans</a></li><li><strong>Kristina Romero:</strong> <a href=\"https://atarim.io/summit/remote-team-management-with-kristina-romero/\">Remotely Managing Projects and Your Team</a></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>This year, each session will be running live &mdash; last year&rsquo;s sessions were pre-recorded. This will allow attendees to be involved in real-time. There will also be a designated Q&amp;A time for each session.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The event is free to attend through the last week of March for anyone. However, the sessions will eventually fall behind a paywall, which helps cover costs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;We offer an All Access Pass for those that want to watch the replays for $97, which is the investment for those that get it before the event,&rdquo; said Peleg. &ldquo;This also includes 30+ sessions from last year&rsquo;s event for a total of 50+ hours of expert advice, specifically designed to help web freelancers and agencies build a solid business.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Success and Lessons Learned From 2020</h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-drop-cap\">Last year&rsquo;s event kick-started as a response to the changing nature of conferences in the Covid-era. Peleg described the initiative as a way of &ldquo;licking our own wounds&rdquo; after his company had planned to attend, sponsor, and have its own retreat at WordCamp Asia in Thailand, which was <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/wordcamp-asia-2020-canceled-over-covid-19-concerns\">canceled in 2020</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;This drove me into action, wanting to lift some spirits in the community,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know that we would end up with the biggest event in the WordPress space and have such incredible partners that came along for the ride.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Last year&rsquo;s event had 5,725 attendees from 126 countries. In total, they watched 53,945 hours of videos. They also won 1,000s of prizes at sponsor booths that included iPads, board games, and more.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;This was way more than what we expected, and the summit platform even broke on the first day when we were getting more than 240,000 requests to the server in an hour,&rdquo; said Peleg. &ldquo;Luckily, there isn&rsquo;t a better community for something like this to happen. Very quickly, some of the sponsors joined forces with some of the speakers and our team and got us back on the air for a full week of action. While they were working to get this sorted, I was mostly pacing back and forth in my office like a headless chicken, but this year we&rsquo;ve come prepared, with load balancers, auto-scaling processes, and a much leaner platform to sustain the scale.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are no plans to switch to a physical Web Agency Summit in the coming years. For now, the virtual model is working.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m very much looking forward to the return of WordCamps as physical events when [Covid-19] blows over, but I believe that virtual events are here to stay, so for the foreseeable future, once a year, we&rsquo;ll bring back our summit as a celebration of the business side of the WordPress industry.&rdquo;</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Fri, 12 Mar 2021 17:16:36 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:14:\"Justin Tadlock\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}s:4:\"type\";i:128;s:7:\"headers\";O:42:\"Requests_Utility_CaseInsensitiveDictionary\":1:{s:7:\"\0*\0data\";a:8:{s:6:\"server\";s:5:\"nginx\";s:4:\"date\";s:29:\"Wed, 07 Apr 2021 14:28:34 GMT\";s:12:\"content-type\";s:8:\"text/xml\";s:4:\"vary\";s:15:\"Accept-Encoding\";s:13:\"last-modified\";s:29:\"Wed, 07 Apr 2021 14:15:09 GMT\";s:15:\"x-frame-options\";s:10:\"SAMEORIGIN\";s:4:\"x-nc\";s:9:\"HIT ord 2\";s:16:\"content-encoding\";s:4:\"gzip\";}}s:5:\"build\";s:14:\"20201016172007\";}', 'no');
